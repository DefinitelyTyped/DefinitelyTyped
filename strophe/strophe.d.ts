         *  Since adding children makes new operations operate on the child, up()

             *
             *  To make Strophe connect to the current host you can leave out the protocol
             *  and host part and just pass the path, e.g.
             *
             *  > var conn = new Strophe.Connection("/http-bind/");

             *  WebSocket options:
             *
             *  If you want to connect to the current host with a WebSocket connection you
             *  can tell Strophe to use WebSockets through a "protocol" attribute in the
             *  optional options parameter. Valid values are "ws" for WebSocket and "wss"
             *  for Secure WebSocket.
             *  So to connect to "wss://CURRENT_HOSTNAME/xmpp-websocket" you would call
             *
             *  > var conn = new Strophe.Connection("/xmpp-websocket/", {protocol: "wss"});
             *

             *  of the current site.
             *
             *  Also because downgrading security is not permitted by browsers, when using
             *  relative URLs both BOSH and WebSocket connections will use their secure
             *  variants if the current connection to the site is also secure (https).

             *  BOSH options:

             *  by adding "sync" to the options, you can control if requests will
             *  be made synchronously or not. The default behaviour is asynchronous.
             *  If you want to make requests synchronous, make "sync" evaluate to true:
             *  > var conn = new Strophe.Connection("/http-bind/", {sync: true});
             *  You can also toggle this on an already established connection:
             *  > conn.options.sync = true;
             *
             *
             *  Parameters:
             *    (String) service - The BOSH or WebSocket service URL.
             *    (Object) options - A hash of configuration options
             *
