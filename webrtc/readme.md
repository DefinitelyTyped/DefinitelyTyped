#  WebRTC Definition Notes

## The WebRTC specification

The WebRTC specification is currently a work in progress, but it has been
implemented at a basic level in recent versions of Chrome, Opera and (to a
lesser extent) Firefox.  The latest version of the specification can be found
at https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/.

This particular set of definitions does not use any vendor-specific prefixes.
Instead, you should probably use [adapter.js](https://github.com/webrtc/adapter).

The definitions track the currently published working draft. Deprecated
features are dropped.
