/**
 * The dictionary that defines attributes to filter the items returned by the [listDirectory()](#FileSystemManager::listDirectory) method (or deprecated [listFiles()](#File::listFiles)).
 * When this dictionary is passed to a method, the result-set of the method will only contain file item entries that match
 * the attribute values of the filter.
 *
 * A file item only matches the _FileFilter_ object if all of the defined filter's attribute values match all of the file item's attributes
 * (only matching values other than undefined or null). This is similar to a SQL's "AND" operation.
 *
 * An attribute of the file entry matches the _FileFilter_ attribute value in accordance with the
 * following rules:
 *
 *
 * *   For _FileFilter_ attributes of type DOMString, an entry matches this value only if its corresponding attribute is an exact match. If the filter contains U+0025 "PERCENT SIGN" it is interpreted as a wildcard character and "%" matches any string of any length, including no length. If wildcards are used, the behavior is similar to the LIKE condition in SQL. To specify that a "PERCENT SIGN" character is to be considered literally instead of interpreting it as a wildcard, developers can escape it with the backslash character (\\\\). Please, remember that the backslash character has to be escaped itself, to not to be removed from the string - proper escaping of the "PERCENT SIGN" in JavaScript string requires preceding it with double backslash ("\\\\\\\\%").
 * The matching is not case sensitive, such as "FOO" matches a "foo" or an "f%" filter.
 * *   For File entry attributes of type Date, attributes start and end are included to allow filtering of File entries between two supplied dates. If either or both of these attributes are specified, the following rules apply:
 * A) If both start and end dates are specified (that is, other than null), a File entry matches the filter if its corresponding attribute is the same as either start or end or between the two supplied dates (that is, after start and before end).
 * B) If only the start attribute contains a value (other than null), a File entry matches the filter if its corresponding attribute is later than or equal to the start one.
 * C) If only the end date contains a value (other than null), a file matches the filter if its corresponding attribute is earlier than or equal to the end date.

     * The Account API provides functionality for using existing configured
     * online accounts and providers, and for creating accounts of known types.
     *
     * The basic concepts are:
     *
     * *   **Provider** is an online service provider entity, such as
     * Google, Vodafone or Facebook. A service provider is identified by its applicationId.
     * Account provider will be registered while the application is installed.
     * The information will be used in the "Add account" screen in Settings.
     * *   **Account** collects all the data (user name, credential, settings)
     * needed for connecting to services. An account is always bound to a single provider,
     * and has a list of service instances bound to the account. The services can be
     * individually enabled and disabled on the given account. For instance,
     * account1@gmail.com can identify a Google account, giving access to services such as
     * gmail, gtalk, Picasa, and Youtube with each service having a separate service
     * instance bound to the account.
     *
     *
     * To use _add(), remove(), and update()_ methods of AccountManager can be invoked only
     * by account provider application. A web application is an account provider when its _config.xml_
     * contains [Account provider section](/application/tizen-studio/web-tools/config-editor#mw_account). For example:
     *
     * ```xml
     * <tizen:account multiple-account-support="true">
     *    <tizen:icon section="Account">icon.png</tizen:icon>
     *    <tizen:icon section="AccountSmall">icon.png</tizen:icon>

     * filesystem. The filesystem API exposes the hierarchies below these root
     * locations as autonomous virtual filesystems.
     *
     * Each virtual root has a string name. Each file or directory within the virtual
     * filesystem is addressed using a fully-qualified path of the form:
     * _root name/path_ where _rootname_ is
     * the name of the virtual root and _path_ is the path to the file or
     * directory relative to that root.
     *
     * The following virtual roots must be supported:
     *
     *
     * *   images - the location for images
     * *   videos - the location for videos
     * *   music - the location for sounds
     * *   documents - the location for documents
     * *   downloads - the location for downloaded items

     * *   wgt-package - the location for widget package which is read-only
     * *   wgt-private - the location for a widget's private storage
     * *   wgt-private-tmp - the location for a widget's private volatile storage
     * *   removable\__..._ - the location for external storages. The _"..."_ suffix is a unique identifier of an external storage.
     * To obtain list of available external storages use [listStorages](#FileSystemManager::listStorages).
     *
     *
     * The file URI path is also supported. To access paths out of virtual root, for example "file:///tmp" can be used as location parameter.
     *
     * The implementation must support the use of the following characters in file names:
     *
     * *   Letters (a-z, A-Z)
     * *   Digits (0-9)
     * *   Blank space
     * *   Underscore ("\_")
     * *   Hyphen ("-")
     * *   Period (".")
     *
     *
     * The implementation may support additional characters in file names, depending on platform support.
     *
     * The implementation may forbid the use of additional characters in file names, depending on the platform.
     * The use of the path (component) separator "/" and null character "\\\\x00" should not be allowed in file names.
     *
     * Some other file name and path characteristics are platform-dependent,
     * for example, maximum path length, file name length, case sensitivity, additional
     * character support, etc. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid any dependency
     * on aspects that cannot be supported across multiple platforms.
     *

     * The issue is correctly converting to and from local time and UTC for all points in
     * time - in any of the past, present, and future - based on an initial time provided.
     * This is important for defining relative dates, where a time in a given location may

     * or any other changes that may occur to a location's time zone over time.

     *
     * There are several formats of input images supported by the stereoscopy
     * plugin:
     *
     * *   Side-by-side: Left and right images are merged into one
     * picture. The left image is at the left side and the right image is at the right
     * side. Both images are scaled to fit in the original
     * image ratio.
     * *   Top-bottom: Left and right images are merged into one
     * picture. The left image is at the top and the right image is at the bottom.
     * Both images are scaled to fit in the original image ratio.
     * *   Line-by-line: Left and right images are interlaced by row.
     * The first row belongs to the left image and the second row
     * belongs to the right image, and so on.
     * *   Vertical-strip: Left and right images are interlaced by column.

 * The Account API provides functionality for using existing configured
 * online accounts and providers, and for creating accounts of known types.
 *
 * The basic concepts are:
 *
 * *   **Provider** is an online service provider entity, such as
 * Google, Vodafone or Facebook. A service provider is identified by its applicationId.
 * Account provider will be registered while the application is installed.
 * The information will be used in the "Add account" screen in Settings.
 * *   **Account** collects all the data (user name, credential, settings)
 * needed for connecting to services. An account is always bound to a single provider,
 * and has a list of service instances bound to the account. The services can be
 * individually enabled and disabled on the given account. For instance,
 * account1@gmail.com can identify a Google account, giving access to services such as
 * gmail, gtalk, Picasa, and Youtube with each service having a separate service
 * instance bound to the account.
 *
 *
 * To use _add(), remove(), and update()_ methods of AccountManager can be invoked only
 * by account provider application. A web application is an account provider when its _config.xml_
 * contains [Account provider section](/application/tizen-studio/web-tools/config-editor#mw_account). For example:
 *
 * ```xml
 * <tizen:account multiple-account-support="true">
 *    <tizen:icon section="Account">icon.png</tizen:icon>

 * The Filesystem API provides access to a device's filesystem.
 *
 * The filesystem is represented as an abstract collection of disjointed filesystem virtual
 * root locations, each corresponding to a specific location in the device
 * filesystem. The filesystem API exposes the hierarchies below these root
 * locations as autonomous virtual filesystems.
 *
 * Each virtual root has a string name. Each file or directory within the virtual
 * filesystem is addressed using a fully-qualified path of the form:
 * _root name/path_ where _rootname_ is
 * the name of the virtual root and _path_ is the path to the file or
 * directory relative to that root.
 *
 * The following virtual roots must be supported:
 *
 *
 * *   images - the location for images
 * *   videos - the location for videos
 * *   music - the location for sounds
 * *   documents - the location for documents
 * *   downloads - the location for downloaded items
 * *   camera - the location for the pictures and videos taken by a device (supported since Tizen 2.3)
 * *   wgt-package - the location for widget package which is read-only
 * *   wgt-private - the location for a widget's private storage
 * *   wgt-private-tmp - the location for a widget's private volatile storage
 * *   removable\__..._ - the location for external storages. The _"..."_ suffix is a unique identifier of an external storage.
 * To obtain list of available external storages use [listStorages](#FileSystemManager::listStorages).
 *
 *
 * The file URI path is also supported. To access paths out of virtual root, for example "file:///tmp" can be used as location parameter.
 *
 * The implementation must support the use of the following characters in file names:
 *
 * *   Letters (a-z, A-Z)
 * *   Digits (0-9)
 * *   Blank space
 * *   Underscore ("\_")
 * *   Hyphen ("-")
 * *   Period (".")
 *
 *
 * The implementation may support additional characters in file names, depending on platform support.
 *
 * The implementation may forbid the use of additional characters in file names, depending on the platform.
 * The use of the path (component) separator "/" and null character "\\\\x00" should not be allowed in file names.
 *
 * Some other file name and path characteristics are platform-dependent,
 * for example, maximum path length, file name length, case sensitivity, additional
 * character support, etc. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid any dependency
 * on aspects that cannot be supported across multiple platforms.
 *
 * The encoding used for the file path should be UTF-16 (default for ECMAScript String).
 *

 * The Time API provides information regarding date/time and time zones.
 *
 * @since 1.0
 *
 * The JavaScript Date object does not have full timezone support.
 * Date objects allow only simple representations to denote a particular location's
 * offset from Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). This is typically provided as a +/-
 * offset from UTC-0 (also known as Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT) for example, +05:30 denotes
 * that a location is 5 hours and 30 minutes ahead of UTC +00:00.
 * The issue with this method is not getting the correct
 * local time for a given date. The existing methods are sufficient for this purpose.
 * The issue is correctly converting to and from local time and UTC for all points in
 * time - in any of the past, present, and future - based on an initial time provided.
 * This is important for defining relative dates, where a time in a given location may
 * observe different UTC offsets, according to any Daylight Savings Rules (DST) in effect
 * or any other changes that may occur to a location's time zone over time.
 * Without the communication of the explicit time zone rules governing a given date and
 * time, the ability to effectively calculate the offset of the local time to UTC or to
 * any other time zone at any point in the past or future is lost.
 *
 * This API can be used to get TZDate objects with full time zone support, convert them
 * between timezones, retrieve available timezones.
 *
 * For more information on the Time features, see [Time Guide](/application/web/guides/device/time).

/**
 * This API provides interfaces for managing stereoscopic 3D effects
 * for television signals.
 *
 * Modern TVs and projectors can display two images, a left image and a right image,
 * which are displayed to the left and right eyes respectively. This technique creates
 * an illusion of depth, which is perceived by users as a 3D image.
 *
 * For more information about stereoscopy, see this
 * [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereoscopy).
 *
 * There are several formats of input images supported by the stereoscopy
 * plugin:
 *
 * *   Side-by-side: Left and right images are merged into one
 * picture. The left image is at the left side and the right image is at the right
 * side. Both images are scaled to fit in the original
 * image ratio.
 * *   Top-bottom: Left and right images are merged into one
 * picture. The left image is at the top and the right image is at the bottom.
 * Both images are scaled to fit in the original image ratio.
 * *   Line-by-line: Left and right images are interlaced by row.
 * The first row belongs to the left image and the second row
 * belongs to the right image, and so on.
 * *   Vertical-strip: Left and right images are interlaced by column.
 * The first column belongs to the left image and the second column
 * belongs to the right image, and so on.
 * *   Frame-sequence: Left and right images are interlaced by frames.
 *
 *
 * Advanced devices are able to computationally generate depth
 * data by processing non-stereoscopic images. Depth data is used
 * to render left and right stereoscopic images from a source image which lacks
 * this information. The quality of such stereoscopic images depends
 * on the computational power used for processing, the algorithms used and the properties
 * of the source data. For more information see this
 * [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2D_to_3D_conversion)
