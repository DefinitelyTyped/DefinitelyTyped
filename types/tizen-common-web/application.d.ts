/**
 * This API provides a way to launch other applications and access
 * application management.
 *
 * The `ApplicationManager` interface also provides methods to launch other applications
 * explicitly and implicitly through the `ApplicationControl` interface.
 * The `ApplicationControl` interface consists of an operation, URI, and MIME type
 * and also describes an action to be performed by other
 * applications and can carry the result from the subsequent application.
 * The `ApplicationManager` interface also provides methods to handle the application
 * lifecycle, to access the installed applications on the device, and to let
 * an application be notified of a change in the application list.
 *
 * The `Application` interface defines the current application's information and
 * the basic operations for the current application such as exit or hide.
 *
 * Since Tizen 2.4 the `Application` interface provides application event broadcasting and listening features. An application can broadcast user events to other listening applications and listen to broadcasted user events from other applications. In a future Tizen release, applications will also be able to receive pre-defined system events from the platform.
 *
 * For more information on the Application features, see Application Guide, Application Group Guide or Application Control Guide.
