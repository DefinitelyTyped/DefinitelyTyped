/**
 * A special version of {@link Mesh} with multi draw batch rendering support. Use {@link BatchedMesh} if you have to
 * render a large number of objects with the same material but with different world transformations and geometry. The
 * usage of {@link BatchedMesh} will help you to reduce the number of draw calls and thus improve the overall rendering
 * performance in your application.
 *
 * If the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WEBGL_multi_draw WEBGL_multi_draw extension} is not
 * supported then a less performant callback is used.
 *
 * @example
 * const box = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );
 * const sphere = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );
 * const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00 } );
 *
 * // initialize and add geometries into the batched mesh
 * const batchedMesh = new BatchedMesh( 10, 5000, 10000, material );
 * const boxId = batchedMesh.addGeometry( box );
 * const sphereId = batchedMesh.addGeometry( sphere );
 *
 * // position the geometries
 * batchedMesh.setMatrixAt( boxId, boxMatrix );
 * batchedMesh.setMatrixAt( sphereId, sphereMatrix );
 *
 * scene.add( batchedMesh );
