/**
 * This class is designed to assist with {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting | raycasting}
 * @remarks
 * Raycasting is used for mouse picking (working out what objects in the 3d space the mouse is over) amongst other things.
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const raycaster = new THREE.Raycaster();
 * const pointer = new THREE.Vector2();
 *
 * function onPointerMove(event) {
 *     // calculate pointer position in normalized device coordinates (-1 to +1) for both components
 *     pointer.x = (event.clientX / window.innerWidth) * 2 - 1;
 *     pointer.y = -(event.clientY / window.innerHeight) * 2 + 1;
 * }
 *
 * function render() {
 *     // update the picking ray with the camera and pointer position
 *     raycaster.setFromCamera(pointer, camera);
 *     // calculate objects intersecting the picking ray
 *     const intersects = raycaster.intersectObjects(scene.children);
 *     for (let i = 0; i & lt; intersects.length; i++) {
 *         intersects[i].object.material.color.set(0xff0000);
 *     }
 *     renderer.render(scene, camera);
 * }
 * window.addEventListener('pointermove', onPointerMove);
 * window.requestAnimationFrame(render);
 * ```
