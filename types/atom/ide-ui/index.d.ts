// Patent:
/**
 Additional Grant of Patent Rights Version 2

 "Software" means the atom-ide-ui software contributed by Facebook, Inc.

 Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook") hereby grants to each recipient of the Software
 ("you") a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable
 (subject to the termination provision below) license under any Necessary
 Claims, to make, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise
 transfer the Software. For avoidance of doubt, no license is granted under
 Facebookâ€™s rights in any patent claims that are infringed by (i) modifications
 to the Software made by you or any third party or (ii) the Software in
 combination with any software or other technology.

 The license granted hereunder will terminate, automatically and without notice,
 if you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates or agents) initiate
 directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent
 Assertion: (i) against Facebook or any of its subsidiaries or corporate
 affiliates, (ii) against any party if such Patent Assertion arises in whole or
 in part from any software, technology, product or service of Facebook or any of
 its subsidiaries or corporate affiliates, or (iii) against any party relating
 to the Software. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Facebook or any of its
 subsidiaries or corporate affiliates files a lawsuit alleging patent
 infringement against you in the first instance, and you respond by filing a
 patent infringement counterclaim in that lawsuit against that party that is
 unrelated to the Software, the license granted hereunder will not terminate
 under section (i) of this paragraph due to such counterclaim.

 A "Necessary Claim" is a claim of a patent owned by Facebook that is
 necessarily infringed by the Software standing alone.

 A "Patent Assertion" is any lawsuit or other action alleging direct, indirect,
 or contributory infringement or inducement to infringe any patent, including a
 cross-claim or counterclaim.
