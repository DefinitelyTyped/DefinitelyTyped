   * {@link module:sap/base/Log.debug}, {@link module:sap/base/Log.info}, {@link module:sap/base/Log.warning},
   * {@link module:sap/base/Log.error} and {@link module:sap/base/Log.fatal} creates and records a log entry,
   * containing a timestamp, a log level, a message with details and a component info. The log level will
   * be one of {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level} and equals the name of the concrete logging method.
   *
   * By using the {@link module:sap/base/Log.setLevel} method, consumers can determine the least important
   * log level which should be recorded. Less important entries will be filtered out. (Note that higher numeric
   * values represent less important levels). The initially set level depends on the mode that UI5 is running
   * in. When the optimized sources are executed, the default level will be {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level.ERROR}.
   * For normal (debug sources), the default level is {@link module:sap/base/Log.Level.DEBUG}.
   *
   * All logging methods allow to specify a **component**. These components are simple strings and don't have
   * a special meaning to the UI5 framework. However they can be used to semantically group log entries that
   * belong to the same software component (or feature). There are two APIs that help to manage logging for
   * such a component. With {@link module:sap/base/Log.getLogger}, one can retrieve a logger that automatically
   * adds the given `sComponent` as component parameter to each log entry, if no other component is specified.
   * Typically, JavaScript code will retrieve such a logger once during startup and reuse it for the rest
   * of its lifecycle. Second, the {@link module:sap/base/Log.setLevel}(iLevel, sComponent) method allows
   * to set the log level for a specific component only. This allows a more fine grained control about the
   * created logging entries. {@link module:sap/base/Log.getLevel} allows to retrieve the currently effective
   * log level for a given component.
   *
   * {@link module:sap/base/Log.getLogEntries} returns an array of the currently collected log entries.
   *
   * Furthermore, a listener can be registered to the log. It will be notified whenever a new entry is added
   * to the log. The listener can be used for displaying log entries in a separate page area, or for sending
   * it to some external target (server).

   *
   * Creates a string from a pattern by replacing placeholders with concrete values.
   *
   * The syntax of the pattern is inspired by (but not fully equivalent to) the java.util.MessageFormat.
   *
   * Placeholders have the form `{ integer }`, where any occurrence of `{0}` is replaced by the value with
   * index 0 in `aValues`, `{1}` by the value with index 1 in `aValues` etc.
   *
   * To avoid interpretation of curly braces as placeholders, any non-placeholder fragment of the pattern
   * can be enclosed in single quotes. The surrounding single quotes will be omitted from the result. Single
   * quotes that are not meant to escape a fragment and that should appear in the result, need to be doubled.
   * In the result, only a single single quote will occur.
   *
   * Example: Pattern Strings
   * ```javascript
   *
   *  formatMessage("Say {0}",     ["Hello"]) -> "Say Hello"    // normal use case
   *  formatMessage("Say '{0}'",   ["Hello"]) -> "Say {0}"      // escaped placeholder
   *  formatMessage("Say ''{0}''", ["Hello"]) -> "Say 'Hello'"  // doubled single quote
   *  formatMessage("Say '{0}'''", ["Hello"]) -> "Say {0}'"     // doubled single quote in quoted fragment
   * ```
   *  In contrast to java.util.MessageFormat, format types or format styles are not supported. Everything
   * after the argument index and up to the first closing curly brace is ignored. Nested placeholders (as
   * supported by java.lang.MessageFormat for the format type choice) are not ignored but reported as a parse
   * error.
   *
   * This method throws an Error when the pattern syntax is not fulfilled (e.g. unbalanced curly braces, nested
   * placeholders or a non-numerical argument index).
   *
   * This method can also be used as a formatter within a binding. The first part of a composite binding will
   * be used as pattern, the following parts as aValues. If there is only one value and this value is an array
   * it will be handled like the default described above.

   * (Commun. ACM, April 1978, Volume 21, Number 4, Pages 264-268).
   *
   * Items in the arrays are not compared directly. Instead, a substitute symbol is determined for each item
   * by applying the provided function `fnSymbol` to it. Items with strictly equal symbols are assumed to
   * represent the same logical item:
   * ```javascript
   *
   *   fnSymbol(a) === fnSymbol(b)   <=>   a 'is logically the same as' b
   * ```
   *  As an additional constraint, casting the symbols to string should not modify the comparison result.
   * If this second constraint is not met, this method might report more diffs than necessary.
   *
   * If no symbol function is provided, a default implementation is used which applies `JSON.stringify` to
   * non-string items and reduces the strings to a hash code. It is not guaranteed that this default implementation
   * fulfills the above constraint in all cases, but it is a compromise between implementation effort, generality
   * and performance. If items are known to be non-stringifiable (e.g. because they may contain cyclic references)
   * or when hash collisions are likely, an own `symbol` function must be provided via the configuration object.
   *
   * The result of the diff is a sequence of update operations, each consisting of a `type` (either `"insert"`,
   * `"delete"` or `"replace"` when enabled via configuration object) and an `index`. By applying the operations
   * one after the other to the old array, it can be transformed to an array whose items are equal to the

   * 			a full URL, or use {@link #.fromQuery UriParameters.fromQuery} when the input only contains the query
   * 			part of an URL (e.g. `location.search`).
   * 	 - do not use the `get` method with the second parameter `bAll`; use the `getAll` method instead
   * 	 - do not access the internal property `mParams` (you never should access internal properties of UI5
   * 			classes or objects). With the predecessor of this API, access to `mParams` was often used to check whether
   * 			a parameter is defined at all. Using the new `has` method or checking the result of `get` against `null`
   * 			serves the same purpose.  Callers using `UriParameters.fromQuery(input)` can be migrated to `new
   * 			URLSearchParams(input)` once the new API is available in all supported browsers. Callers using `UriParameters.fromURL(input)`
   * 			can be migrated to `new URL(input).searchParams` then.

   * @SINCE 1.58.0
   *
   * The module `sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport` provides functionality which is used to find declared Components
   * in the HTML page and to create the Component instances which will be put into a {@link sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer}.
   *
   * The {@link module:sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport.run} function is called automatically once the module
   * has been required. This allows declarative support for components.
   *
   * Usage: To enable the `sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport` include it as the `oninit` module in the bootstrap:
   *
   * ```javascript
   *
   * <script id="sap-ui-bootstrap"
   *     src="/resources/sap-ui-core.js"
   *     ...
   *     data-sap-ui-oninit="module:sap/ui/core/ComponentSupport"
   *     ...>
   * </script>
   * ```
   *
   *
   * To load and render components inside the HTML page, a special data attribute has to be specified on the
   * respective DOM elements: `data-sap-ui-component`. All DOM elements marked with this data attribute will
   * be regarded as container elements for the created `ComponentContainer` instances.
   *
   *
   * ```javascript
   *
   * <body id="content" class="sapUiBody sapUiSizeCompact">
   *     ...
   *     <div data-sap-ui-component
   *         data-id="container"
   *         data-name="sap.ui.core.samples.formatting"
   *         ...
   *         data-handle-validation="true"
   *         ...>
   *     </div>
   *     ...
   * </body>
   * ```
   *
   *
   * Configuration: All configuration settings for the `ComponentContainer` have to be defined as `data` attributes
   * on the respective HTML tags. Each data attribute will be interpreted as a setting and parsed considering
   * the data type of the matching property in the `ComponentContainer`.
   *
   * As HTML is case-insensitive, in order to define a property with upper-case characters, you have to "escape"
   * them with a dash character, similar to CSS attributes. The following code gives an example:
   *
   *
   * ```javascript
   *
   * <div data-sap-ui-component ... data-handle-validation="true" ...></div>
   * ```
   *
   *
   * **Beware:**
   *
   * The `ComponentSupport` module enforces asynchronous loading of the respective component and its library
   * dependencies. This is done by applying default settings for the following properties of the `ComponentContainer`:
   *
   *
   * 	 - `async` {boolean} (**forced to `true`**)
   * 	 - `manifest` {boolean|string} (**forced to `true` if no string is provided to ensure manifest first**)
   *
   * 	 - `lifecycle` {sap.ui.core.ComponentLifecycle} (defaults to `Container`)
   * 	 - `autoPrefixId` {boolean} (defaults to `true`)
   *
   * See {@link topic:82a0fcecc3cb427c91469bc537ebdddf Declarative API for Initial Components}.

     * 			and convert them to the corresponding value; `isValid` will accept any of the values from the plain object's
     * 			keys. The `defaultValue` will be the value of the first key found in the plain object
     * 	 - When a global property exist with any other, non-falsy value, a warning is logged and the primitive

  /**
   * Base Class that introduces some basic concepts, such as, state management and data binding.
   *
   * New subclasses of ManagedObject are created with a call to {@link #.extend ManagedObject.extend} and
   * can make use of the following managed features:
   *
   * Properties: Managed properties represent the state of a ManagedObject. They can store a single value
   * of a simple data type (like 'string' or 'int'). They have a name (e.g. 'size') and methods to
   * get the current value (`getSize`), or to set a new value (`setSize`). When a property is modified by
   * calling the setter, the ManagedObject is marked as invalidated. A managed property can be bound against
   * a property in a {@link sap.ui.model.Model} by using the {@link #bindProperty} method. Updates to the
   * model property will be automatically reflected in the managed property and - if TwoWay databinding is
   * active, changes to the managed property will be reflected in the model. An existing binding can be removed
   * by calling {@link #unbindProperty}.
   *
   * If a ManagedObject is cloned, the clone will have the same values for its managed properties as the source
   * of the clone - if the property wasn't bound. If it is bound, the property in the clone will be bound
   * to the same model property as in the source.
   *
   * Details about the declaration of a managed property, the metadata that describes it and the set of methods
   * that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend
   * extend } method.
   *
   * Aggregations: Managed aggregations can store one or more references to other ManagedObjects. They are
   * a mean to control the lifecycle of the aggregated objects: one ManagedObject can be aggregated by at
   * most one parent ManagedObject at any time. When a ManagedObject is destroyed, all aggregated objects
   * are destroyed as well and the object itself is removed from its parent. That is, aggregations won't contain
   * destroyed objects or null/undefined.
   *
   * Aggregations have a name ('e.g 'header' or 'items'), a cardinality ('0..1' or '0..n') and
   * are of a specific type (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a UI5 interface).
   * A ManagedObject will provide methods to set or get the aggregated object for a specific aggregation of
   * cardinality 0..1 (e.g. `setHeader`, `getHeader` for an aggregation named 'header'). For an aggregation
   * of cardinality 0..n, there are methods to get all aggregated objects (`getItems`), to locate an object
   * in the aggregation (e.g. `indexOfItem`), to add, insert or remove a single aggregated object (`addItem`,
   * `insertItem`, `removeItem`) or to remove or destroy all objects from an aggregation (`removeAllItems`,
   * `destroyItems`).
   *
   * Details about the declaration of a managed aggregation, the metadata that describes the aggregation,
   * and the set of methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation
   * of the {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.
   *
   * Aggregations of cardinality 0..n can be bound to a collection in a model by using {@link #bindAggregation}
   * (and unbound again using {@link #unbindAggregation}). For each context in the model collection, a corresponding
   * object will be created in the managed aggregation, either by cloning a template object or by calling
   * a factory function.
   *
   * Aggregations also control the databinding context of bound objects: by default, aggregated objects inherit
   * all models and binding contexts from their parent object.
   *
   * When a ManagedObject is cloned, all aggregated objects will be cloned as well - but only if they haven't
   * been added by databinding. In that case, the aggregation in the clone will be bound to the same model
   * collection.
   *
   * Associations: Managed associations also form a relationship between objects, but they don't define a
   * lifecycle for the associated objects. They even can 'break' in the sense that an associated object might
   * have been destroyed already although it is still referenced in an association. For the same reason, the
   * internal storage for associations are not direct object references but only the IDs of the associated
   * target objects.
   *
   * Associations have a name ('e.g 'initialFocus'), a cardinality ('0..1' or '0..n') and are
   * of a specific type (which must be a subclass of ManagedObject as well or a UI5 interface). A ManagedObject
   * will provide methods to set or get the associated object for a specific association of cardinality 0..1
   * (e.g. `setInitialFocus`, `getInitialFocus`). For an association of cardinality 0..n, there are methods
   * to get all associated objects (`getRefItems`), to add, insert or remove a single associated object (`addRefItem`,
   * `insertRefItem`, `removeRefItem`) or to remove all objects from an association (`removeAllRefItems`).
   *
   * Details about the declaration of a managed association, the metadata that describes it and the set of
   * methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link
   * sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.
   *
   * Associations can't be bound to the model.
   *
   * When a ManagedObject is cloned, the result for an association depends on the relationship between the
   * associated target object and the root of the clone operation. If the associated object is part of the
   * to-be-cloned object tree (reachable via aggregations from the root of the clone operation), then the
   * cloned association will reference the clone of the associated object. Otherwise the association will
   * reference the same object as in the original tree. When a ManagedObject is destroyed, other objects that
   * are only associated, are not affected by the destroy operation.
   *
   * Events: Managed events provide a mean for communicating important state changes to an arbitrary number
   * of 'interested' listeners. Events have a name and (optionally) a set of parameters. For
   * each event there will be methods to add or remove an event listener as well as a method to fire the event.
   * (e.g. `attachChange`, `detachChange`, `fireChange` for an event named 'change').
   *
   * Details about the declaration of managed events, the metadata that describes the event, and the set of
   * methods that are automatically generated to access it, can be found in the documentation of the {@link
   * sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend extend} method.
   *
   * When a ManagedObject is cloned, all listeners registered for any event in the clone source are also registered
   * to the clone. Later changes are not reflected in any direction (neither from source to clone, nor vice
   * versa).
   *
   * Low Level APIs:: The prototype of ManagedObject provides several generic, low
   * level APIs to manage properties, aggregations, associations, and events. These generic methods are solely
   * intended for implementing higher level, non-generic methods that manage a single managed property etc.
   * (e.g. a function `setSize(value)` that sets a new value for property 'size'). {@link sap.ui.base.ManagedObject.extend}
   * creates default implementations of those higher level APIs for all managed aspects. The implementation
   * of a subclass then can override those default implementations with a more specific implementation, e.g.
   * to implement a side effect when a specific property is set or retrieved. It is therefore important to
   * understand that the generic low-level methods ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR GENERIC ACCESS to the state of a managed
   * object, as that would bypass the overriding higher level methods and their side effects.
   */
  export default class ManagedObject extends EventProvider {
    /**
     * Constructs and initializes a managed object with the given `sId` and settings.
     *
     * If the optional `mSettings` are given, they must be a simple object that defines values for properties,
     * aggregations, associations or events keyed by their name.
     *
     * **Valid Names and Value Ranges:**
     *
     * The property (key) names supported in the object literal are exactly the (case sensitive) names documented
     * in the JSDoc for the properties, aggregations, associations and events of the current class and its base
     * classes. Note that for 0..n aggregations and associations this name usually is the plural name, whereas
     * it is the singular name in case of 0..1 relations.
     *
     * The possible values for a setting depend on its kind:
     * 	 - for simple properties, the value has to match the documented type of the property (no type conversion
     * 			occurs)
     * 	 - for 0..1 aggregations, the value has to be an instance of the aggregated type
     * 	 - for 0..n aggregations, the value has to be an array of instances of the aggregated type or a single
     * 			instance
     * 	 - for 0..1 associations, an instance of the associated type or an id (string) is accepted
     * 	 - for 0..n associations, an array of instances of the associated type or of IDs is accepted
     * 	 - for events, either a function (event handler) is accepted or an array of length 2 where the first
     * 			element is a function and the 2nd element is an object to invoke the method on; or an array of length
     * 			3, where the first element is an arbitrary payload object, the second one is a function and the 3rd one
     * 			is an object to invoke the method on; or an array of arrays where each nested array has the 2 or 3 element
     * 			structure described before (multiple listeners).
     *
     * Each subclass should document the name and type of its supported settings in its constructor documentation.
     *
     * Example usage:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * new Dialog({
     *    title: "Some title text",            // property of type "string"
     *    showHeader: true,                    // property of type "boolean"
     *    endButton: new Button(...),          // 0..1 aggregation
     *    content: [                           // 0..n aggregation
     *       new Input(...),
     *       new Input(...)
     *    ],
     *    afterClose: function(oEvent) { ... } // event handler function
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Instead of static values and object instances, data binding expressions can be used, either embedded
     * in a string or as a binding info object as described in {@link #bindProperty} or {@link #bindAggregation}.
     *
     * Example usage:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * new Dialog({
     *    title: "{/title}",       // embedded binding expression, points to a string property in the data model
     *    ...
     *    content: {               // binding info object
     *       path : "/inputItems", // points to a collection in the data model
     *       template : new Input(...)
     *    }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Note that when setting string values, any curly braces in those values need to be escaped, so they are
     * not interpreted as binding expressions. Use {@link #escapeSettingsValue} to do so.
     *
     * Besides the settings documented below, ManagedObject itself supports the following special settings:
     *
     * 	 - `id : sap.ui.core.ID` an ID for the new instance. Some subclasses (Element, Component) require
     * 			the id to be unique in a specific scope (e.g. an Element Id must be unique across all Elements, a Component
     * 			id must be unique across all Components). `models : object` a map of {@link sap.ui.model.Model}
     * 			instances keyed by their model name (alias). Each entry with key k in this object has the same
     * 			effect as a call `this.setModel(models[k], k);`.
     * 	 - `bindingContexts : object` a map of {@link sap.ui.model.Context} instances keyed by their
     * 			model name. Each entry with key k in this object has the same effect as a call `this.setBindingContext(bindingContexts[k],
     * 			k);`
     * 	 - `objectBindings : object` a map of binding paths keyed by the corresponding model name. Each
     * 			entry with key k in this object has the same effect as a call `this.bindObject(objectBindings[k],
     * 			k);` `metadataContexts : object` an array of single binding contexts keyed by the corresponding
     * 			model or context name. The purpose of the `metadataContexts` special setting is to deduce as much information
     * 			as possible from the binding context of the control in order to be able to predefine certain standard
     * 			properties like e.g. visible, enabled, tooltip,...
     *
     * The structure is an array of single contexts, where a single context is a map containing the following
     * keys:
     * 	 - `path: string (mandatory)` The path to the corresponding model property or object, e.g. '/Customers/Name'.
     * 			A path can also be relative, e.g. 'Name'
     * 	 - `model: string (optional)` The name of the model, in case there is no name then the undefined
     * 			model is taken
     * 	 - `name: string (optional)` A name for the context to used in templating phase
     * 	 - `kind: string (optional)` The kind of the adapter, either `field` for single properties or
     * 			`object` for structured contexts. `adapter: string (optional)` The path to an interpretion
     * 			class that dilivers control relevant data depending on the context, e.g. enabled, visible. If not supplied
     * 			the OData meta data is interpreted.  The syntax for providing the `metadataContexts` is as follows:
     * 			`{SINGLE_CONTEXT1},...,{SINGLE_CONTEXTn}` or for simplicity in case there is only one context `{SINGLE_CONTEXT}`.
     *
     * Examples for such metadataContexts are:
     * 	 - `{/Customers/Name}` a single part with an absolute path to the property Name of the Customers
     * 			entity set in the default model
     * 	 - `{path: 'Customers/Name', model:'json'}` a single part with an absolute path to the property Name
     * 			of the Customers entity set in a named model
     * 	 - `{parts: [{path: 'Customers/Name'},{path: 'editable', model: 'viewModel'}]}` a combination of single
     * 			binding contexts, one context from the default model and one from the viewModel

     * in the JSDoc for the properties, aggregations, associations and events of the current class and its base
     * classes. Note that for 0..n aggregations and associations this name usually is the plural name, whereas
     * it is the singular name in case of 0..1 relations.
     *
     * The possible values for a setting depend on its kind:
     * 	 - for simple properties, the value has to match the documented type of the property (no type conversion
     * 			occurs)
     * 	 - for 0..1 aggregations, the value has to be an instance of the aggregated type
     * 	 - for 0..n aggregations, the value has to be an array of instances of the aggregated type or a single
     * 			instance
     * 	 - for 0..1 associations, an instance of the associated type or an id (string) is accepted
     * 	 - for 0..n associations, an array of instances of the associated type or of IDs is accepted
     * 	 - for events, either a function (event handler) is accepted or an array of length 2 where the first
     * 			element is a function and the 2nd element is an object to invoke the method on; or an array of length
     * 			3, where the first element is an arbitrary payload object, the second one is a function and the 3rd one
     * 			is an object to invoke the method on; or an array of arrays where each nested array has the 2 or 3 element
     * 			structure described before (multiple listeners).
     *
     * Each subclass should document the name and type of its supported settings in its constructor documentation.
     *
     * Example usage:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * new Dialog({
     *    title: "Some title text",            // property of type "string"
     *    showHeader: true,                    // property of type "boolean"
     *    endButton: new Button(...),          // 0..1 aggregation
     *    content: [                           // 0..n aggregation
     *       new Input(...),
     *       new Input(...)
     *    ],
     *    afterClose: function(oEvent) { ... } // event handler function
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Instead of static values and object instances, data binding expressions can be used, either embedded
     * in a string or as a binding info object as described in {@link #bindProperty} or {@link #bindAggregation}.
     *
     * Example usage:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * new Dialog({
     *    title: "{/title}",       // embedded binding expression, points to a string property in the data model
     *    ...
     *    content: {               // binding info object
     *       path : "/inputItems", // points to a collection in the data model
     *       template : new Input(...)
     *    }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Note that when setting string values, any curly braces in those values need to be escaped, so they are
     * not interpreted as binding expressions. Use {@link #escapeSettingsValue} to do so.
     *
     * Besides the settings documented below, ManagedObject itself supports the following special settings:
     *
     * 	 - `id : sap.ui.core.ID` an ID for the new instance. Some subclasses (Element, Component) require
     * 			the id to be unique in a specific scope (e.g. an Element Id must be unique across all Elements, a Component
     * 			id must be unique across all Components). `models : object` a map of {@link sap.ui.model.Model}
     * 			instances keyed by their model name (alias). Each entry with key k in this object has the same
     * 			effect as a call `this.setModel(models[k], k);`.
     * 	 - `bindingContexts : object` a map of {@link sap.ui.model.Context} instances keyed by their
     * 			model name. Each entry with key k in this object has the same effect as a call `this.setBindingContext(bindingContexts[k],
     * 			k);`
     * 	 - `objectBindings : object` a map of binding paths keyed by the corresponding model name. Each
     * 			entry with key k in this object has the same effect as a call `this.bindObject(objectBindings[k],
     * 			k);` `metadataContexts : object` an array of single binding contexts keyed by the corresponding
     * 			model or context name. The purpose of the `metadataContexts` special setting is to deduce as much information
     * 			as possible from the binding context of the control in order to be able to predefine certain standard
     * 			properties like e.g. visible, enabled, tooltip,...
     *
     * The structure is an array of single contexts, where a single context is a map containing the following
     * keys:
     * 	 - `path: string (mandatory)` The path to the corresponding model property or object, e.g. '/Customers/Name'.
     * 			A path can also be relative, e.g. 'Name'
     * 	 - `model: string (optional)` The name of the model, in case there is no name then the undefined
     * 			model is taken
     * 	 - `name: string (optional)` A name for the context to used in templating phase
     * 	 - `kind: string (optional)` The kind of the adapter, either `field` for single properties or
     * 			`object` for structured contexts. `adapter: string (optional)` The path to an interpretion
     * 			class that dilivers control relevant data depending on the context, e.g. enabled, visible. If not supplied
     * 			the OData meta data is interpreted.  The syntax for providing the `metadataContexts` is as follows:
     * 			`{SINGLE_CONTEXT1},...,{SINGLE_CONTEXTn}` or for simplicity in case there is only one context `{SINGLE_CONTEXT}`.
     *
     * Examples for such metadataContexts are:
     * 	 - `{/Customers/Name}` a single part with an absolute path to the property Name of the Customers
     * 			entity set in the default model
     * 	 - `{path: 'Customers/Name', model:'json'}` a single part with an absolute path to the property Name
     * 			of the Customers entity set in a named model
     * 	 - `{parts: [{path: 'Customers/Name'},{path: 'editable', model: 'viewModel'}]}` a combination of single
     * 			binding contexts, one context from the default model and one from the viewModel

     *
     * Detailed explanation of properties
     *
     *
     * **'library'** : string
     *  Name of the library that the new subclass should belong to. If the subclass is a control or element,
     * it will automatically register with that library so that authoring tools can discover it. By convention,
     * the name of the subclass should have the library name as a prefix, but subfolders are allowed, e.g. `sap.ui.layout.form.Form`
     * belongs to library `sap.ui.layout`.
     *
     * **'properties'** : object
     *  An object literal whose properties each define a new managed property in the ManagedObject subclass.
     * The value can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new property
     * or it can be an object literal with the following properties
     * 	 - `type: string` type of the new property. Must either be one of the built-in types 'string',
     * 			'boolean', 'int', 'float', 'object', 'function' or 'any', or a type created and registered with {@link
     * 			sap.ui.base.DataType.createType} or an array type based on one of the previous types (e.g. 'int[]' or
     * 			'string[]', but not just 'array').
     * 	 - `visibility: string` either 'hidden' or 'public', defaults to 'public'. Properties that belong
     * 			to the API of a class must be 'public' whereas 'hidden' properties can only be used internally. Only
     * 			public properties are accepted by the constructor or by `applySettings` or in declarative representations
     * 			like an `XMLView`. Equally, only public properties are cloned.
     * 	 - `byValue: boolean` (either can be omitted or set to the boolean value `true`) If set to `true`,
     * 			the property value will be {@link module:sap/base/util/deepClone deep cloned} on write and read operations
     * 			to ensure that the internal value can't be modified by the outside. The property `byValue` is currently
     * 			restricted to a `boolean` value. Other types are reserved for future use. Class definitions must only
     * 			use boolean values for the flag (or omit it), but readers of ManagedObject metadata should handle any
     * 			truthy value as `true` to be future safe. Note that using `byValue:true` has a performance impact on
     * 			property access and therefore should be used carefully. It also doesn't make sense to set this option
     * 			for properties with a primitive type (they have value semantic anyhow) or for properties with arrays
     * 			of primitive types (they are already cloned with a less expensive implementation). `group:string`
     * 			a semantic grouping of the properties, intended to be used in design time tools. Allowed values are (case
     * 			sensitive): Accessibility, Appearance, Behavior, Data, Designtime, Dimension, Identification, Misc
     * 	 - `defaultValue: any` the default value for the property or null if there is no defaultValue.
     *
     * 	 - `bindable: boolean|string` (either can be omitted or set to the boolean value `true` or the
     * 			magic string 'bindable') If set to `true` or 'bindable', additional named methods `bindName` and
     * 			`unbindName` are generated as convenience. Despite its name, setting this flag is not mandatory
     * 			to make the managed property bindable. The generic methods {@link #bindProperty} and {@link #unbindProperty}
     * 			can always be used.  `selector: string` Optional; can be set to a valid CSS selector (as accepted
     * 			by the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector Element.prototype.querySelector}
     * 			method). When set, it locates the DOM element that represents this property's value. It should only be
     * 			set for properties that have a visual text representation in the DOM.
     *
     * The purpose of the selector is to allow other framework parts or design time tooling to identify the
     * DOM parts of a control or element that represent a specific property without knowing the control or element
     * implementation in detail.
     *
     * As an extension to the standard CSS selector syntax, the selector string can contain the placeholder
     * `{id}` (multiple times). Before evaluating the selector in the context of an element or control, all
     * occurrences of the placeholder have to be replaced by the (potentially escaped) ID of that element or
     * control. In fact, any selector should start with `#{id}` to ensure that the query result is limited to
     * the desired element or control.
     *
     * **Note**: there is a convenience method {@link sap.ui.core.Element#getDomRefForSetting} that evaluates
     * the selector in the context of a concrete element or control instance. It also handles the placeholder
     * `{id}`. Only selected framework features may use that private method, it is not yet a public API and
     * might be changed or removed in future versions of UI5. However, instead of maintaining the `selector`
     * in the metadata, element and control classes can overwrite `getDomRefForSetting` and determine the DOM
     * element dynamically.  Property names should use camelCase notation, start with a lowercase
     * letter and only use characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. If an aggregation in the literal is preceded
     * by a JSDoc comment (doclet) and if the UI5 plugin and template are used for JSDoc3 generation, the doclet
     * will be used as generic documentation of the aggregation.
     *
     * For each public property 'foo', the following methods will be created by the "extend" method and will
     * be added to the prototype of the subclass:
     * 	 - getFoo() - returns the current value of property 'foo'. Internally calls {@link #getProperty}
     * 	 - setFoo(v) - sets 'v' as the new value of property 'foo'. Internally calls {@link #setProperty}
     * 	 - bindFoo(c) - (only if property was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps {@link
     * 			#bindProperty}
     * 	 - unbindFoo() - (only if property was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps {@link
     * 			#unbindProperty}  For hidden properties, no methods are generated.
     *
     * **'defaultProperty'** : string
     *  When specified, the default property must match the name of one of the properties defined for the new
     * subclass (either own or inherited). The named property can be used to identify the main property to be
     * used for bound data. E.g. the value property of a field control.
     *
     * **'aggregations'** : object
     *  An object literal whose properties each define a new aggregation in the ManagedObject subclass. The
     * value can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new aggregation
     * or it can be an object literal with the following properties
     * 	 - `type: string` type of the new aggregation. must be the full global name of a ManagedObject
     * 			subclass or UI5 interface (in dot notation, e.g. 'sap.m.Button')
     * 	 - `[multiple]: boolean` whether the aggregation is a 0..1 (false) or a 0..n aggregation (true),
     * 			defaults to true
     * 	 - `[singularName]: string`. Singular name for 0..n aggregations. For 0..n aggregations the name
     * 			by convention should be the plural name. Methods affecting multiple objects in an aggregation will use
     * 			the plural name (e.g. getItems(), whereas methods that deal with a single object will use the singular
     * 			name (e.g. addItem). The framework knows a set of common rules for building plural form of English nouns
     * 			and uses these rules to determine a singular name on its own. if that name is wrong, a singluarName can
     * 			be specified with this property.
     * 	 - `[visibility]: string` either 'hidden' or 'public', defaults to 'public'. Aggregations that
     * 			belong to the API of a class must be 'public' whereas 'hidden' aggregations typically are used for the
     * 			implementation of composite classes (e.g. composite controls). Only public aggregations are accepted
     * 			by the constructor or by `applySettings` or in declarative representations like an `XMLView`. Equally,
     * 			only public aggregations are cloned.
     * 	 - `bindable: boolean|string` (either can be omitted or set to the boolean value `true` or the
     * 			magic string 'bindable') If set to `true` or 'bindable', additional named methods `bindName` and
     * 			`unbindName` are generated as convenience. Despite its name, setting this flag is not mandatory
     * 			to make the managed aggregation bindable. The generic methods {@link #bindAggregation} and {@link #unbindAggregation}
     * 			can always be used.
     * 	 - `forwarding: object` If set, this defines a forwarding of objects added to this aggregation
     * 			into an aggregation of another ManagedObject - typically to an inner control within a composite control.
     * 			This means that all adding, removal, or other operations happening on the source aggregation are actually
     * 			called on the target instance. All elements added to the source aggregation will be located at the target
     * 			aggregation (this means the target instance is their parent). Both, source and target element will return
     * 			the added elements when asked for the content of the respective aggregation. If present, the named (non-generic)
     * 			aggregation methods will be called for the target aggregation. Aggregations can only be forwarded to
     * 			non-hidden aggregations of the same or higher multiplicity (i.e. an aggregation with multiplicity "0..n"
     * 			cannot be forwarded to an aggregation with multiplicity "0..1"). The target aggregation must also be
     * 			"compatible" to the source aggregation in the sense that any items given to the source aggregation must
     * 			also be valid in the target aggregation (otherwise the target element will throw a validation error).
     * 			If the forwarded elements use data binding, the target element must be properly aggregated by the source
     * 			element to make sure all models are available there as well. The aggregation target must remain the same
     * 			instance across the entire lifetime of the source control. Aggregation forwarding will behave unexpectedly
     * 			when the content in the target aggregation is modified by other actors (e.g. by the target element or
     * 			by another forwarding from a different source aggregation). Hence, this is not allowed. The forwarding
     * 			configuration object defines the target of the forwarding. The available settings are:
     * 	`idSuffix: string`A string which is appended to the ID of this ManagedObject to construct
     * the ID of the target ManagedObject. This is one of the two options to specify the target. This option
     * requires the target instance to be created in the init() method of this ManagedObject and to be always
     * available.
     * 	 - `getter: string`The name of the function on instances of this ManagedObject which returns
     * 			the target instance. This second option to specify the target can be used for lazy instantiation of the
     * 			target. Note that either idSuffix or getter must be given. Also note that the target instance returned
     * 			by the getter must remain the same over the entire lifetime of this ManagedObject and the implementation
     * 			assumes that all instances return the same type of object (at least the target aggregation must always
     * 			be defined in the same class).
     * 	 - `aggregation: string`The name of the aggregation on the target into which the objects shall
     * 			be forwarded. The multiplicity of the target aggregation must be the same as the one of the source aggregation
     * 			for which forwarding is defined.
     * 	 - `[forwardBinding]: boolean`Whether any binding should happen on the forwarding target or not.
     * 			Default if omitted is `false`, which means any bindings happen on the outer ManagedObject. When the binding
     * 			is forwarded, all binding methods like updateAggregation, getBindingInfo, refreshAggregation etc. are
     * 			called on the target element of the forwarding instead of being called on this element. The basic aggregation
     * 			mutator methods (add/remove etc.) are only called on the forwarding target element. Without forwardBinding,
     * 			they are called on this element, but forwarded to the forwarding target, where they actually modify the
     * 			aggregation.    `selector: string` Optional; can be set to a valid CSS selector
     * 			(as accepted by the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/querySelector Element.prototype.querySelector}
     * 			method). When set, it locates the DOM element that surrounds the aggregation's content. It should only
     * 			be set for aggregations that have a visual representation in the DOM. A DOM element surrounding the aggregation's
     * 			rendered content should be available in the DOM, even if the aggregation is empty or not rendered for
     * 			some reason. In cases where this is not possible or not intended, `getDomRefForSetting` can be overridden,
     * 			see below.
     *
     * The purpose of the selector is to allow other framework parts like drag and drop or design time tooling
     * to identify those DOM parts of a control or element that represent a specific aggregation without knowing
     * the control or element implementation in detail.
     *
     * As an extension to the standard CSS selector syntax, the selector string can contain the placeholder
     * `{id}` (multiple times). Before evaluating the selector in the context of an element or control, all
     * occurrences of the placeholder have to be replaced by the (potentially escaped) ID of that element or
     * control. In fact, any selector should start with `#{id}` to ensure that the query result is limited to
     * the desired element or control.
     *
     * **Note**: there is a convenience method {@link sap.ui.core.Element#getDomRefForSetting} that evaluates
     * the selector in the context of a concrete element or control instance. It also handles the placeholder
     * `{id}`. Only selected framework features may use that private method, it is not yet a public API and
     * might be changed or removed in future versions of UI5. However, instead of maintaining the `selector`
     * in the metadata, element and control classes can overwrite `getDomRefForSetting` to calculate or add
     * the appropriate DOM Element dynamically.   Aggregation names should use camelCase notation,
     * start with a lowercase letter and only use characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. The name for a hidden
     * aggregations might start with an underscore. If an aggregation in the literal is preceded by a JSDoc
     * comment (doclet) and if the UI5 plugin and template are used for JSDoc3 generation, the doclet will be
     * used as generic documentation of the aggregation.
     *
     * For each public aggregation 'item' of cardinality 0..1, the following methods will be created by the
     * "extend" method and will be added to the prototype of the subclass:
     * 	 - getItem() - returns the current value of aggregation 'item'. Internally calls {@link #getAggregation}
     * 			with a default value of `undefined`
     * 	 - setItem(o) - sets 'o' as the new aggregated object in aggregation 'item'. Internally calls {@link
     * 			#setAggregation}
     * 	 - destroyItem(o) - destroy a currently aggregated object in aggregation 'item' and clears the aggregation.
     * 			Internally calls {@link #destroyAggregation}
     * 	 - bindItem(c) - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
     * 			{@link #bindAggregation}
     * 	 - unbindItem() - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
     * 			{@link #unbindAggregation}  For a public aggregation 'items' of cardinality 0..n, the following
     * 			methods will be created:
     * 	 - getItems() - returns an array with the objects contained in aggregation 'items'. Internally calls
     * 			{@link #getAggregation} with a default value of `[]`
     * 	 - addItem(o) - adds an object as last element in the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #addAggregation}
     *
     * 	 - insertItem(o,p) - inserts an object into the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #insertAggregation}
     *
     * 	 - indexOfItem(o) - returns the position of the given object within the aggregation 'items'. Internally
     * 			calls {@link #indexOfAggregation}
     * 	 - removeItem(v) - removes an object from the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAggregation}
     *
     * 	 - removeItems() - removes all objects from the aggregation 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAllAggregation}
     *
     * 	 - destroyItems() - destroy all currently aggregated objects in aggregation 'items' and clears the aggregation.
     * 			Internally calls {@link #destroyAggregation}
     * 	 - bindItems(c) - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
     * 			{@link #bindAggregation}
     * 	 - unbindItems() - (only if aggregation was defined to be 'bindable'): convenience function that wraps
     * 			{@link #unbindAggregation}  For hidden aggregations, no methods are generated.
     *
     * **'defaultAggregation'** : string
     *  When specified, the default aggregation must match the name of one of the aggregations defined for the
     * new subclass (either own or inherited). The named aggregation will be used in contexts where no aggregation
     * is specified. E,g. when an object in an XMLView embeds other objects without naming an aggregation, as
     * in the following example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *  <!-- assuming the defaultAggregation for Dialog is 'content' -->
     *  <Dialog>
     *    <Text/>
     *    <Button/>
     *  </Dialog>
     * ```
     *
     *
     * **'associations'** : object
     *  An object literal whose properties each define a new association of the ManagedObject subclass. The
     * value can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new association
     * or it can be an object literal with the following properties
     * 	 - `type: string` type of the new association
     * 	 - `multiple: boolean` whether the association is a 0..1 (false) or a 0..n association (true),
     * 			defaults to false(1) for associations
     * 	 - `[singularName]: string`. Singular name for 0..n associations. For 0..n associations the name
     * 			by convention should be the plural name. Methods affecting multiple objects in an association will use
     * 			the plural name (e.g. getItems(), whereas methods that deal with a single object will use the singular
     * 			name (e.g. addItem). The framework knows a set of common rules for building plural form of English nouns
     * 			and uses these rules to determine a singular name on its own. if that name is wrong, a singluarName can
     * 			be specified with this property.
     * 	 - `visibility: string` either 'hidden' or 'public', defaults to 'public'. Associations that
     * 			belong to the API of a class must be 'public' whereas 'hidden' associations can only be used internally.
     * 			Only public associations are accepted by the constructor or by `applySettings` or in declarative representations
     * 			like an `XMLView`. Equally, only public associations are cloned.  Association names should use camelCase
     * 			notation, start with a lowercase letter and only use characters from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. If an association
     * 			in the literal is preceded by a JSDoc comment (doclet) and if the UI5 plugin and template are used for
     * 			JSDoc3 generation, the doclet will be used as generic documentation of the association.
     *
     * For each association 'ref' of cardinality 0..1, the following methods will be created by the "extend"
     * method and will be added to the prototype of the subclass:
     * 	 - getRef() - returns the current value of association 'item'. Internally calls {@link #getAssociation}
     * 			with a default value of `undefined`
     * 	 - setRef(o) - sets 'o' as the new associated object in association 'item'. Internally calls {@link
     * 			#setAssociation}  For a public association 'refs' of cardinality 0..n, the following methods will
     * 			be created:
     * 	 - getRefs() - returns an array with the objects contained in association 'items'. Internally calls
     * 			{@link #getAssociation} with a default value of `[]`
     * 	 - addRef(o) - adds an object as last element in the association 'items'. Internally calls {@link #addAssociation}
     *
     * 	 - removeRef(v) - removes an object from the association 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAssociation}
     *
     * 	 - removeAllRefs() - removes all objects from the association 'items'. Internally calls {@link #removeAllAssociation}
     * 			 For hidden associations, no methods are generated.
     *
     * **'events'** : object
     *  An object literal whose properties each define a new event of the ManagedObject subclass. The value
     * can either be a simple string which then will be assumed to be the type of the new association or it
     * can be an object literal with the following properties
     * 	 - `allowPreventDefault: boolean` whether the event allows to prevented the default behavior
     * 			of the event source
     * 	 - `parameters: object` an object literal that describes the parameters of this event.
     * 			Event names should use camelCase notation, start with a lower-case letter and only use characters from
     * 			the set [a-zA-Z0-9_$]. If an event in the literal is preceded by a JSDoc comment (doclet) and if the
     * 			UI5 plugin and template are used for JSDoc3 generation, the doclet will be used as generic documentation
     * 			of the event.
     *
     * For each event 'Some' the following methods will be created by the "extend" method and will be added
     * to the prototype of the subclass:
     * 	 - attachSome(fn,o) - registers a listener for the event. Internally calls {@link #attachEvent}
     * 	 - detachSome(fn,o) - deregisters a listener for the event. Internally calls {@link #detachEvent}
     * 	 - fireSome() - fire the event. Internally calls {@link #fireEvent}
     *
     * **'specialSettings'** : object
     *  Special settings are an experimental feature and MUST NOT BE DEFINED in controls or applications outside
     * of the `sap.ui.core` library. There's no generic or general way how to set or get the values for special
     * settings. For the same reason, they cannot be bound against a model. If there's a way for consumers to
     * define a value for a special setting, it must be documented in the class that introduces the setting.

    /**
     * Binds a property to the model.
     *
     * Whenever the corresponding model becomes available or changes (either via a call to {@link #setModel
     * setModel} or propagated from a {@link #getParent parent}), its {@link sap.ui.model.Model#bindProperty
     * bindProperty} method will be called to create a new {@link sap.ui.model.PropertyBinding PropertyBinding}
     * with the configured binding options.
     *
     * The Setter for the given property will be called by the binding with the value retrieved from the data
     * model. When the binding mode is `OneTime`, the property will be set only once. When it is `OneWay`, the
     * property will be updated whenever the corresponding data in the model changes. In mode `TwoWay`, changes
     * to the property (not originating in the model) will be reported back to the model (typical use case:
     * user interaction changes the value of a control).
     *
     * This is a generic method which can be used to bind any property to the model. A managed object may flag
     * any property in its metadata with `bindable: "bindable"` to additionally provide named methods to bind
     * and unbind the corresponding property.
     *
     * **Composite Binding**
     *  A composite property binding which combines data from multiple model paths can be declared using the
     * `parts` parameter instead of `path`. The `formatter` function or a {@link sap.ui.model.CompositeType
     * composite type} then can be used to combine the parts, Properties with a composite binding are also known
     * as "calculated fields".
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   oTxt.bindValue({
     *     parts: [
     *       {path: "/firstName", type: "sap.ui.model.type.String"},
     *       {path: "myModel2>/lastName"}
     *     ]
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Note that a composite binding will be forced into mode `OneWay` when one of the binding parts is not
     * in mode `TwoWay`.
     *
     * **Static Binding**
     *  A StaticBinding allows to define static values within a `sap.ui.model.CompositeBinding`. It behaves
     * like a property binding but always returns the value that is stored in the binding itself. The binding
     * does not have a `sap.ui.model.Context`, a `sap.ui.model.Model` or a `oBindingInfo.path`. A StaticBinding
     * is created when a `oBindingInfo.value` is passed instead of a `oBindingInfo.path` or `oBindingInfo.parts[i].path`.
     *
     * Also see {@link sap.ui.model.StaticBinding StaticBinding} in the documentation.
     *
     * **Formatter Functions**
     *  When a formatter function is specified for the binding or for a binding part, it will be called with
     * the value of the bound model property. After setting the initial property value, the formatter function
     * will only be called again when the bound model property changes (simple property binding) or when at
     * least one of the bound model properties changes (formatter function of a composite binding). Note that
     * a binding only monitors the bound model data for changes. Dependencies of the formatter implementation
     * to other model data is not known to the binding and changes won't be detected.
     *
     * When the formatter for a property binding (simple or composite) is called, the managed object will be
     * given as `this` context. For formatters of binding parts in a composite binding, this is not the case.
     *
     * Also see {@link topic:91f0652b6f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070 Property Binding} in the documentation.

     *
     * The `oOptions` configuration object can have the following properties:
     * 	 - The boolean value `cloneChildren` specifies whether associations/aggregations will be cloned
     * 	 - The boolean value `cloneBindings` specifies if bindings will be cloned  Note: In case the configuration
     * 			`oOptions` is specified, the default values `true` no longer apply, which means in case `cloneChildren`
     * 			or `cloneBindings` is not specified, then this ia assumed to be `false` and associations/aggregations
     * 			or bindings are not cloned.
     *
     * For each cloned object, the following settings are cloned based on the metadata of the object and the
     * defined options:
     * 	 - All properties that are not bound. If `cloneBindings` is `false`, also the bound properties will
     * 			be cloned; in general, values are referenced 1:1, not cloned. For some property types, however, the getters
     * 			or setters might clone the value (e.g. array types and properties using metadata option `byValue`)
     * 	 - All aggregated objects that are not bound. If `cloneBindings` is `false`, also the ones that are
     * 			bound will be cloned; they are all cloned recursively using the same `sIdSuffix`
     * 	 - All associated controls; when an association points to an object inside the cloned object tree, then
     * 			the cloned association will be modified so that it points to the clone of the target object. When the
     * 			association points to a managed object outside of the cloned object tree, then its target won't be changed.
     *
     * 	 - All models set via `setModel()`; used by reference.
     * 	 - All property and aggregation bindings (if `cloneBindings` is `true`); the pure binding information
     * 			(path, model name) is cloned, but all other information like template control or factory function, data
     * 			type or formatter function are copied by reference. The bindings themselves are created anew as they
     * 			are specific for the combination (object, property, model). As a result, any later changes to a binding
     * 			of the original object are not reflected in the clone, but changes to e.g the type or template etc. are.
     *
     *
     * Each clone is created by first collecting the above mentioned settings and then creating a new instance
     * with the normal constructor function. As a result, any side effects of mutator methods (`setProperty`
     * etc.) or init hooks are repeated during clone creation. There is no need to override `clone()` just to
     * reproduce these internal settings!
     *
     * Custom controls however can override `clone()` to implement additional clone steps. They usually will

     * etc. It might differ from the object on which the application originally added this object (the so called
     * 'API parent'): some composite controls internally use hidden controls or containers to store their children.
     * This method will return the innermost container that technically contains this object as a child.
     *
     * **Example:**
     *
     * Assume that a `Dialog` internally uses a (hidden) `VerticalLayout` to store its content:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   Dialog (API parent)
     *    \__ VerticalLayout (hidden composite part)
     *       \__ Text (API child)
     * ```
     *
     *
     * If you add some content by calling the `Dialog.prototype.addContent` API, this will lead to the following
     * observations:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   oDialog.addContent(oText);
     *   console.log(oText.getParent() === oDialog);  // false
     *   console.log(oText.getParent() instanceof VerticalLayout); // true
     *   console.log(oText.getParent().getParent() === oDialog); // true now, but might fail with later versions
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Technically, from API perspective, `oText` is added as a child to `Dialog`. But internally, the `Dialog`
     * adds the child to the hidden `VerticalLayout` container. If you now call the `getParent` method of the
     * child, you will get the internal `VerticalLayout` object and not the `Dialog` API parent.
     *
     * **Note: ** The internal (hidden) structure of a composite control is not fixed and may be changed (see
     * also our "Compatibility Rules"). Therefore, you should **never** rely on a specific structure or object
     * being returned by `getParent`.

     *
     * `oClassInfo` might contain three kinds of information:
     * 	 - `metadata:` an (optional) object literal with metadata about the class. The information in the object
     * 			literal will be wrapped by an instance of {@link sap.ui.base.Metadata Metadata} and might contain the
     * 			following information
     * 	`interfaces:` {string[]} (optional) set of names of implemented interfaces (defaults to no interfaces)
     *
     * 	 - `publicMethods:` {string[]} (optional) list of methods that should be part of the public facade of
     * 			the class
     * 	 - `abstract:` {boolean} (optional) flag that marks the class as abstract (purely informational, defaults
     * 			to false)
     * 	 - `final:` {boolean} (optional) flag that marks the class as final (defaults to false)  Subclasses
     * 			of sap.ui.base.Object can enrich the set of supported metadata (e.g. see {@link sap.ui.core.Element.extend}).
     *
     *
     *
     * 	 - `constructor:` a function that serves as a constructor function for the new class. If no constructor
     * 			function is given, the framework creates a default implementation that delegates all its arguments to
     * 			the constructor function of the base class.
     *
     * any-other-name: any other property in the `oClassInfo` is copied into the prototype object
     * of the newly created class. Callers can thereby add methods or properties to all instances of the class.
     * But be aware that the given values are shared between all instances of the class. Usually, it doesn't
     * make sense to use primitive values here other than to declare public constants.
     *
     * If such a property has a function as its value, and if the property name does not start with an underscore
     * or with the prefix "on", the property name will be automatically added to the list of public methods
     * of the class (see property `publicMethods` in the `metadata` section). If a method's name matches that
     * pattern, but is not meant to be public, it shouldn't be included in the class info object, but be assigned
     * to the prototype instead.
     *
     *
     *
     * The prototype object of the newly created class uses the same prototype as instances of the base class
     * (prototype chaining).
     *
     * A metadata object is always created, even if there is no `metadata` entry in the `oClassInfo` object.
     * A getter for the metadata is always attached to the prototype and to the class (constructor function)
     * itself.
     *
     * Last but not least, with the third argument `FNMetaImpl` the constructor of a metadata class can be specified.
     * Instances of that class will be used to represent metadata for the newly created class and for any subclass
     * created from it. Typically, only frameworks will use this parameter to enrich the metadata for a new
     * class hierarchy they introduce (e.g. {@link sap.ui.core.Element.extend Element}).

   * All controls (subclasses of `sap.ui.core.Control`) provide the support custom style classes. The control

   * control. In general, this option is not available for elements because elements do not necessarily have
   * a representation in the DOM.
   *
   * This function can be used by a control developer to explicitly enrich the API of his/her element implementation
   * with the API functions for the custom style class support. It must be called on the prototype of the
   * element.
   *
   * **Usage Example:**
   * ```javascript
   *
   * sap.ui.define(['sap/ui/core/Element', 'sap/ui/core/CustomStyleClassSupport'], function(Element, CustomStyleClassSupport) {
   *    "use strict";
   *    var MyElement = Element.extend("my.MyElement", {

   *          //...

   *       //...
   *    });
   *
   *    CustomStyleClassSupport.apply(MyElement.prototype);
   *
   *    return MyElement;
   * }, true);
   * ```
   *
   *
   * Furthermore, the function `oRenderManager.writeClasses(oElement);` ({@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#writeClasses})
   * must be called within the renderer of the control to which the element belongs, when writing the root
   * tag of the element. This ensures the classes are written to the HTML.
   *
   * This function adds the following functions to the elements prototype:
   * 	 - `addStyleClass`: {@link sap.ui.core.Control#addStyleClass}
   * 	 - `removeStyleClass`: {@link sap.ui.core.Control#removeStyleClass}
   * 	 - `toggleStyleClass`: {@link sap.ui.core.Control#toggleStyleClass}
   * 	 - `hasStyleClass`: {@link sap.ui.core.Control#hasStyleClass}  In addition the clone function of
   * 			the element is extended to ensure that the custom style classes are also available on the cloned element.
   *
   * **Note:** This function can only be used within control development. An application cannot add
   * style class support on existing elements by calling this function.

   * and the special values "auto" and "inherit" are NOT allowed. Mathematical expressions
   * using the CSS3 `calc(expression)` operator are allowed as long as they do not use percentage sizes.

   * Note that CSS might not allow all these values for every CSS property representing a size. So even if

   * In other words: UI5 controls usually don't extend the range of allowed values in CSS.
   *
   * **Units**
   *
   * Valid font-relative units are `em, ex` and `rem`. Supported absolute units are `cm, mm, in, pc, pt` and
   * `px`. Other units are not supported.
   *
   * **Mathematical Expressions**
   *
   * Expressions inside the `calc()` operator are only roughly checked for validity. Not every value that
   * this type accepts is a valid expression in the sense of the CSS spec. But vice versa, any expression
   * that is valid according to the spec should be accepted by this type. The current implementation is based
   * on the {@link http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-values-3/#calc-syntax CSS3 Draft specification from 22 April
   * 2015}.
   *
   * Noteworthy details:
   * 	 - whitespace is mandatory around a '-' or '+' operator and optional otherwise
   * 	 - parentheses are accepted but not checked for being balanced (a restriction of regexp based checks)
   *
   * 	 - semantic constraints like type restrictions are not checked
   *
   * Future versions of UI5 might check `calc()` expressions in more detail, so applications should not assume

   * expressions using the CSS3 `calc(expression)` operator. Furthermore, length units representing
   * a percentage of the current viewport dimensions: width (vw), height (vh), the smaller of the two (vmin),
   * or the larger of the two (vmax) can also be defined as a CSS size.
   *
   * Note that CSS does not allow all these values for every CSS property representing a size. E.g. `padding-left`
   * doesn't allow the value `auto`. So even if a value is accepted by `sap.ui.core.CSSSize`, it still might
   * have no effect in a specific context. In other words: UI5 controls usually don't extend the range of
   * allowed values in CSS.
   *
   * **Units**
   *
   * Valid font-relative units are `em, ex` and `rem`. Viewport relative units `vw, vh, vmin, vmax` are also
   * valid. Supported absolute units are `cm, mm, in, pc, pt` and `px`.Other units are not supported yet.
   *
   * **Mathematical Expressions**
   *
   * Expressions inside the `calc()` operator are only roughly checked for validity. Not every value that
   * this type accepts might be a valid expression in the sense of the CSS spec. But vice versa, any expression
   * that is valid according to the spec should be accepted by this type. The current implementation is based
   * on the {@link http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-values-3/#calc-syntax CSS3 Draft specification from 22 April
   * 2015}.
   *
   * Noteworthy details:
   * 	 - whitespace is mandatory around a '-' or '+' operator and optional otherwise
   * 	 - parentheses are accepted but not checked for being balanced (a restriction of regexp based checks)
   *
   * 	 - semantic constraints like type restrictions are not checked
   *
   * Future versions of UI5 might check `calc()` expressions in more detail, so applications should not assume
   * that a value, that is invalid according to the CSS spec but currently accepted by this type still will
   * be accepted by future versions of this type.

     *
     * <Button press="cmd:MyCommand" />

     *
     *
     * When the press event is fired, the CommandExecution will be triggered and the `execute` event is fired.
     *
     * When using commands, the component will create a model named `$cmd`. The model data provides the enabled
     * and visible state of all CommandExecutions. With that, action-triggering controls (e.g. a button) can
     * be bound to the enable/visible property of the CommandExecution to centrally control their state.
     *
     * **Note: The usage of the `$cmd` model is restricted to `sap.suite.ui.generic`**
     *
     * When binding a button's enabled state to this model, it follows the enabled state of the CommandExecution.
     * The binding path must be relative like `myCommand/enabled`:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Button press="cmd:MyCommand" enabled="$cmd>MyCommand/enabled" />
     * ```

     *
     * A CommandExecution can have three states:
     * 	 - the CommandExecution is visible and enabled. If the configured shortcut is executed, the configured
     * 			event handler of this CommandExecution is called
     * 	 - the CommandExecution is visible but not enabled. If the configured shortcut is executed, neither
     * 			the configured event handler of this CommandExecution nor any event handler configured on CommandExecutions
     * 			in the ancestor chain is called
     * 	 - the CommandExecution is not visible. If the configured shortcut is executed, the configured event
     * 			handler of this CommandExecution is not called, but the event is propagated to its parent, which can
     * 			then handle the event by a configured CommandExecution or propagate the event to its parent, until no
     * 			parent exits anymore and the browser can handle the executed shortcut
     *

     *   Log.error(oError);
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * The following example shows how `createComponent` can be used to create a nested component by providing
     * specific properties like `id`, `async`, `settings`, or `componentData`:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * var oComponent = oComponent.createComponent({

     *   id: "myId",
     *   settings: { ... },
     *   componentData: { ... }
     * });
     * ```
     *  The allowed list of properties are defined in the parameter documentation of this function.
     *
     * The properties can also be defined in the descriptor. These properties can be overwritten by the local
     * properties of that function.

     *       }
     *     }
     *   }
     *   [...]
     * }
     * ```
     *  The service declaration is used to define a mapping between the local alias for the service that can
     * be used in the Component and the name of the service factory which will be used to create a service instance.
     *
     * The `getService` function will look up the service factory and will create a new instance by using the
     * service factory function {@link sap.ui.core.service.ServiceFactory#createInstance createInstance} The
     * optional property defines that the service is not mandatory and the usage will not depend on the availability
     * of this service. When requesting an optional service the `getService` function will reject but there
     * will be no error logged in the console.
     *
     * When creating a new instance of the service the Component context will be passed as `oServiceContext`
     * as follows:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * {
     *   "scopeObject": this,     // the Component instance
     *   "scopeType": "component" // the stereotype of the scopeObject
     * }
     * ```
     *
     *
     * The service will be created only once per Component and reused in future calls to the `getService` function.
     *  This function will return a `Promise` which provides the service interface when resolved. If the
     * `factoryName` could not be found in the {@link sap.ui.core.service.ServiceFactoryRegistry Service Factory
     * Registry} or the service declaration in the descriptor for components (manifest.json) is missing the
     * Promise will reject.
     *
     * This is an example of how the `getService` function can be used:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * oComponent.getService("myLocalServiceAlias").then(function(oService) {
     *   oService.doSomething();
     * }).catch(function(oError) {

     * before any language dependent objects are created. Applications that need to support more dynamic changes
     * of the language should listen to the `localizationChanged` event and adapt all language dependent objects
     * that they use (e.g. by rebuilding their UI).
     *
     * Currently, the framework notifies the following objects about a change of the localization settings before
     * it fires the `localizationChanged` event:
     *
     *
     * 	 - date and number data types that are used in property bindings or composite bindings in existing Elements,
     * 			Controls, UIAreas or Components
     * 	 - ResourceModels currently assigned to the Core, a UIArea, Component, Element or Control
     * 	 - Elements or Controls that implement the `onlocalizationChanged` hook (note the lowercase 'l' in onlocalizationChanged)
     *
     *
     * It furthermore derives the RTL mode from the new language, if no explicit RTL mode has been set. If the
     * RTL mode changes, the following additional actions will be taken:
     *
     *
     * 	 - the URLs of already loaded library theme files will be changed
     * 	 - the `dir` attribute of the page will be changed to reflect the new mode.
     * 	 - all UIAreas will be invalidated (which results in a rendering of the whole UI5 UI)
     *
     * This method does not accept SAP language codes for `sLanguage`. Instead, a second parameter `sSAPLogonLanguage`
     * can be provided with an SAP language code corresponding to the given language. A given value will be
     * returned by the {@link #getSAPLogonLanguage} method. It is up to the caller to provide a consistent pair
     * of BCP47 language and SAP language code. The SAP language code is only checked to be of length 2 and

  /**
   * Base Class for Controls.
   *
   * Controls provide the following features:
   * 	 - **Rendering**: the `RenderManager` only expects instances of class `Control` in its {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#renderControl
   * 			renderControl} method. By convention, each control class has an associated static class that takes care
   * 			of rendering the control (its 'Renderer').
   * 	 - **show / hide**: a control can be hidden, although it is still part of the control tree, see property
   * 			{@link #getVisible visible}
   * 	 - **local busy indicator**: marks a control visually as 'busy', see properties {@link #getBusy busy}
   * 			and {@link #getBusyIndicatorDelay busyIndicatorDelay}
   * 	 - **field groups**: by assigning the same group ID to a set of editable controls, they form a group
   * 			which can be validated together. See property {@link #getFieldGroupIds fieldGroupIds} and event {@link
   * 			#event:validateFieldGroup validateFieldGroup}. The term field was chosen as most often this feature
   * 			will be used to group editable fields in a form. See the documentation for {@link topic:5b0775397e394b1fb973fa207554003e
   * 			Field Groups} for more details.
   * 	 - **custom style classes**: all controls allow to add custom CSS classes to their rendered DOM without
   * 			modifying their renderer code. See methods {@link #addStyleClass addStyleClass}, {@link #removeStyleClass
   * 			removeStyleClass}, {@link #toggleStyleClass toggleStyleClass} and {@link #hasStyleClass hasStyleClass}.
   *  The necessary implementation is encapsulated in {@link sap.ui.core.CustomStyleClassSupport CustomStyleClassSupport}
   * and can be applied to selected element classes as well.
   * 	 - **browser events**: by calling the methods {@link #attachBrowserEvent attachBrowserEvent} and {@link
   * 			#detachBrowserEvent detachBrowserEvent}, consumers can let the control class take care of registering
   * 			/ de-registering a given set of event listeners to the control's root DOM node. The framework will adapt
   * 			the registration whenever the DOM node changes (e.g. before or after rendering or when the control is
   * 			destroyed).
   *
   * See section "{@link topic:8dcab0011d274051808f959800cabf9f Developing Controls}" in the documentation
   * for an introduction to control development.

     * plus the following `renderer` property:
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * Control.extend("sap.mylib.MyControl", {
     *   metadata : {
     *     library : "sap.mylib",

     *       oRM.close("div");
     *     }
     *   }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * There are multiple ways how a renderer can be specified:
     * 	 - As a **plain object**: The object will be used to create a new renderer by using {@link sap.ui.core.Renderer.extend}
     * 			to extend the renderer of the base class of this control. The new renderer will have the same global
     * 			name as this control class with the additional suffix 'Renderer'.
     *  **Note:** The `Renderer.extend` method expects a plain object (no prototype chain).
     * 	 - As a **function**: The given function will be used as `render` function of a new renderer; the renderer
     * 			will be created in the same way as described for the plain object case.
     * 	 - As a **ready-made renderer**, e.g. imported from the corresponding renderer module. As renderers
     * 			are simple objects (not instances of a specific class), some heuristic is used to distinguish renderers
     * 			from the plain object case above: An object is assumed to be a ready-made renderer when it has
     * 			a `render` function and either is already exposed under the expected global name or has an `extend` method.
     *
     * 	 - As a **fully qualified name**: The name will be looked up as a global property. If not defined, a
     * 			module name will be derived from the global name (dots replaced by slashes), the module will be required
     * 			and provides the renderer, either as AMD export or via the named global property.
     * 	 - **Omitting the `renderer` property** or setting it to `undefined`: The fully qualified name of the
     * 			renderer will be derived from the fully qualified name of the control by adding the suffix "Renderer".
     * 			The renderer then is retrieved in the same way as described for the fully qualified name case.
     *
     * 	 - **`null` or empty string**: The control will have no renderer, a call to `oControl.getMetadata().getRenderer()`
     * 			will return `undefined`.
     *
     * If the resulting renderer is incomplete (has no `render` function) or if it cannot be found at all, rendering
     * of the control will be skipped.
     *
     * **Note:** The `apiVersion: 2` flag is required to enable in-place rendering technology. Before setting
     * this property, please ensure that the constraints documented in section "Contract for Renderer.apiVersion
     * 2" of the {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager RenderManager} API documentation are fulfilled.

     * Provides the framework with information about a library.
     *
     * This method is intended to be called exactly once while the main module of a library (its `library.js`
     * module) is executing, typically at its begin. The single parameter `oLibInfo` is an info object that
     * describes the content of the library.
     *
     * When the `oLibInfo` has been processed, a normalized version of it will be kept and will be returned
     * as library information in later calls to {@link #getLoadedLibraries}. Finally, `initLibrary` fires (the
     * currently private) {@link #event:LibraryChanged} event with operation 'add' for the newly loaded library.
     *
     * Side Effects:
     *
     * While analyzing the `oLibInfo`, the framework takes some additional actions:
     *
     *
     * 	 - If the info object contains a list of `interfaces`, they will be registered with the {@link sap.ui.base.DataType}
     * 			class to make them available as aggregation types in managed objects.
     *
     *
     * 	 - If the object contains a list of `controls` or `elements`, {@link sap.ui.lazyRequire lazy stubs}
     * 			will be created for their constructor as well as for their static `extend` and `getMetadata` methods.
     *  **Note:** Future versions might abandon the concept of lazy stubs as it requires synchronous XMLHttpRequests
     * which have been deprecated (see {@link http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org}). To be on the safe side, productive
     * applications should always require any modules that they directly depend on.
     *
     *
     * 	 - With the `noLibraryCSS` property, the library can be marked as 'theming-free'. Otherwise, the framework
     * 			will add a <link> tag to the page's head, pointing to the library's theme-specific stylesheet.
     * 			The creation of such a <link> tag can be suppressed with the {@link sap.ui.core.Configuration global
     * 			configuration option} `preloadLibCss`. It can contain a list of library names for which no stylesheet
     * 			should be included. This is e.g. useful when an application merges the CSS for multiple libraries and
     * 			already loaded the resulting stylesheet.
     *
     *
     * 	 - If a list of library `dependencies` is specified in the info object, those libraries will be loaded
     * 			synchronously by `initLibrary`.
     *  **Note:** Dependencies between libraries don't have to be modeled as AMD dependencies. Only when enums
     * or types from an additional library are used in the coding of the `library.js` module, the library should
     * be additionally listed in the AMD dependencies.
     *
     * Last but not least, higher layer frameworks might want to include their own metadata for libraries. The
     * property `extensions` might contain such additional metadata. Its structure is not defined by the framework,
     * but it is strongly suggested that each extension only occupies a single property in the `extensions`
     * object and that the name of that property contains some namespace information (e.g. library name that
     * introduces the feature) to avoid conflicts with other extensions. The framework won't touch the content
     * of `extensions` but will make it available in the library info objects returned by {@link #getLoadedLibraries}.
     *
     * Relationship to Descriptor for Libraries (manifest.json):
     *
     * The information contained in `oLibInfo` is partially redundant to the content of the descriptor for the
     * same library (its `manifest.json` file). Future versions of UI5 might ignore the information provided
     * in `oLibInfo` and might evaluate the descriptor file instead. Library developers therefore should keep
     * the information in both files in sync.
     *
     * When the `manifest.json` is generated from the `.library` file (which is the default for UI5 libraries
     * built with Maven), then the content of the `.library` and `library.js` files must be kept in sync.
     *
     * @returns As of version 1.101; returns the library namespace, based on the given library name. Returns
     * 'undefined' if no library name is provided.

     * Loads the given library and its dependencies and makes its content available to the application.

     * What it does:
     *
     * When library preloads are not suppressed for the given library, then a library-preload bundle will be
     * loaded for it. By default, the bundle will be loaded synchronously (for compatibility reasons). Only
     * when the optional parameter `vUrl` is given as `true` or as a configuration object with a property of
     * `async:true`, then the bundle will be loaded asynchronously and a `Promise` will be returned (preferred
     * usage).
     *
     * After preloading the bundle, dependency information from the bundle is evaluated and any missing libraries
     * are also preloaded.
     *
     * Only then the library entry module (named `your/lib/library.js`) will be required and executed.
     * The module is supposed to call `sap.ui.getCore().initLibrary(...)` providing the framework with additional
     * metadata about the library, e.g. its version, the set of contained enums, types, interfaces, controls
     * and elements and whether the library requires CSS. If the library requires CSS, a <link> will be
     * added to the page referring to the corresponding `library.css` stylesheet for the library and the current
     * theme.
     *
     * When the optional parameter `vUrl` is given as a string or when a configuration object is given with
     * a non-empty, string-valued property `url`, then that URL will be registered for the namespace of the
     * library and all resources will be loaded from that location. This is convenience for a call like
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   sap.ui.loader.config({
     *     paths: {
     *       "lib/with/slashes": vUrl
     *     }
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * When the given library has been loaded already, no further action will be taken, especially, a given
     * URL will not be registered! In the case of asynchronous loading, a Promise will be returned, but will
     * be resolved immediately.
     *
     * When to use:
     *
     * For applications that follow the best practices and use components with component descriptors (manifest.json),
     * the framework will load all declared mandatory libraries and their dependencies automatically before
     * instantiating the application component.
     *
     * The same is true for libraries that are listed in the bootstrap configuration (e.g. with the attribute
     * `data-sap-ui-libs`). They will be loaded before the `init` event of the UI5 Core is fired.
     *
     * Only when an app declares a library to be a lazy library dependency or when code does not use descriptors
     * at all, then an explicit call to `loadLibrary` becomes necessary. The call should be made before artifacts
     * (controls, elements, types, helpers, modules etc.) from the library are used or required. This allows
     * the framework to optimize access to those artifacts.
     *
     * For example, when an app uses a heavy-weight charting library that shouldn't be loaded during startup,
     * it can declare it as "lazy" and load it just before it loads and displays a view that uses the charting
     * library:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   sap.ui.getCore().loadLibrary("heavy.charting", {async: true})
     *     .then(function() {
     *       View.create({
     *         name: "myapp.views.HeavyChartingView",
     *         type: ViewType.XML
     *       });
     *     });
     * ```

  /**
   * Delegate for the navigation between DOM nodes with the keyboard.
   *
   * The `ItemNavigation` provides keyboard and mouse navigation between DOM nodes representing items. This
   * means that controls rendering a list of items can attach this delegate to get a common keyboard and mouse
   * support to navigate between these items. It is possible to navigate between the items via the arrow keys.
   * If needed, paging using the Page Up and Page Down keys is possible. (To activate call `setPageSize` with
   * a value > 0.) HOME and END keys are also supported. Focusing an item via mouse also is also supported.
   * For mouse navigation, the `mousedown` event is used.
   *
   * As the `ItemNavigation` works with DOM nodes, the items and the control area must be provided as DOM
   * references. There is one root DOM reference (set via `setRootDomRef`). All item DOM references (set via
   * `setItemDomRefs`) must be places somewhere inside of this root DOM reference. Only focusable items are
   * used for the navigation, meaning disabled items or separator items are just ignored by navigating through
   * the items. In some cases however, it makes sense to put the non-focusable items in the array of the DOM
   * references to keep the indexes stable or like in the calling control. **Hint:** To make a DOM reference
   * focusable a `tabindex` of -1 can be set.
   *
   * **Note** After re-rendering of the control or changing the DOM nodes of the control, the DOM references
   * of the `ItemNavigation` must be updated. Then the same item (corresponding to the index) will get the
   * focus.
   *
   * The `ItemNavigation` adjusts the `tabindex` of all DOM references relating to the current focused item.
   * So if the control containing the items gets the focus (e.g. via tab navigation), it is always the focused
   * items which will be focused.
   *
   * **Note:** If the `ItemNavigation` is nested in another `ItemNavigation` (e.g. `SegmentedButton` in `Toolbar`),
   * the `RootDomRef` will always have `tabindex` -1.
   *
   * Per default the `ItemNavigation` cycles over the items. It navigates again to the first item if the Arrow
   * Down or Arrow Right key is pressed while the last item has the focus. It navigates to the last item if
   * arrow up or arrow left is pressed while the first item has the focus. If you want to stop the navigation
   * at the first and last item, call the `setCycling` method with a value of `false`.
   *
   * It is possible to have multiple columns in the item navigation. If multiple columns are used, the keyboard
   * navigation changes. The Arrow Right and Arrow Left keys will take the user to the next or previous item,
   * and the Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys will navigate the same way but in a vertical direction.
   *
   * The `ItemNavigation` also allows setting a selected index that is used to identify the selected item.
   * Initially, if no other focus is set, the selected item will be the focused one. Note that navigating
   * through the items will not change the selected item, only the focus. (For example a radio group has one
   * selected item.)

  /**
   * Base Class for UI Elements.
   *
   * `Element` is the most basic building block for UI5 UIs. An `Element` has state like a `ManagedObject`,
   * it has a unique ID by which the framework remembers it. It can have associated DOM, but it can't render
   * itself. Only {@link sap.ui.core.Control Controls} can render themselves and also take care of rendering
   * `Elements` that they aggregate as children. If an `Element` has been rendered, its related DOM gets the
   * same ID as the `Element` and thereby can be retrieved via API. When the state of an `Element` changes,
   * it informs its parent `Control` which usually re-renders then.
   *
   * Dispatching Events:
   *
   * The UI5 framework already registers generic listeners for common browser events, such as `click` or `keydown`.
   * When called, the generic listener first determines the corresponding target element using {@link jQuery#control}.
   * Then it checks whether the element has an event handler method for the event. An event handler method
   * by convention has the same name as the event, but prefixed with "on": Method `onclick` is the handler
   * for the `click` event, method `onkeydown` the handler for the `keydown` event and so on. If there is
   * such a method, it will be called with the original event as the only parameter. If the element has a
   * list of delegates registered, their handler functions will be called the same way, where present. The
   * set of implemented handlers might differ between element and delegates. Not each handler implemented
   * by an element has to be implemented by its delegates, and delegates can implement handlers that the corresponding
   * element doesn't implement.
   *
   * A list of browser events that are handled that way can be found in {@link module:sap/ui/events/ControlEvents}.
   * Additionally, the framework dispatches pseudo events ({@link module:sap/ui/events/PseudoEvents}) using
   * the same naming convention. Last but not least, some framework events are also dispatched that way, e.g.
   * `BeforeRendering`, `AfterRendering` (only for controls) and `ThemeChanged`.
   *
   * If further browser events are needed, controls can register listeners on the DOM using native APIs in
   * their `onAfterRendering` handler. If needed, they can do this for their aggregated elements as well.
   * If events might fire often (e.g. `mousemove`), it is best practice to register them only while needed,
   * and deregister afterwards. Anyhow, any registered listeners must be cleaned up in the `onBeforeRendering`
   * listener and before destruction in the `exit` hook.
   */
  export default class UI5Element extends ManagedObject {
    /**
     * Constructs and initializes a UI Element with the given `sId` and settings.
     *
     * Uniqueness of IDs:
     *
     * Each `Element` must have an ID. If no `sId` or `mSettings.id` is given at construction time, a new ID
     * will be created automatically. The IDs of all elements that exist at the same time in the same window
     * must be different. Providing an ID which is already used by another element throws an error.
     *
     * When an element is created from a declarative source (e.g. XMLView), then an ID defined in that declarative
     * source needs to be unique only within the declarative source. Declarative views will prefix that ID with
     * their own ID (and some separator) before constructing the element. Programmatically created views (JSViews)
     * can do the same with the {@link sap.ui.core.mvc.View#createId} API. Similarly, UIComponents can prefix
     * the IDs of elements created in their context with their own ID. Also see {@link sap.ui.core.UIComponent#getAutoPrefixId
     * UIComponent#getAutoPrefixId}.
     *
     * Settings: If the optional `mSettings` are given, they must be a JSON-like object (object literal) that
     * defines values for properties, aggregations, associations or events keyed by their name.
     *
     * **Valid Names:**
     *
     * The property (key) names supported in the object literal are exactly the (case sensitive) names documented
     * in the JSDoc for the properties, aggregations, associations and events of the control and its base classes.
     * Note that for 0..n aggregations and associations this usually is the plural name, whereas it is the singular
     * name in case of 0..1 relations.
     *
     * Each subclass should document the set of supported names in its constructor documentation.
     *
     * **Valid Values:**
     *
     *
     * 	 - for normal properties, the value has to be of the correct simple type (no type conversion occurs)
     *
     * 	 - for 0..1 aggregations, the value has to be an instance of the aggregated control or element type
     *
     * 	 - for 0..n aggregations, the value has to be an array of instances of the aggregated type
     * 	 - for 0..1 associations, an instance of the associated type or an id (string) is accepted
     * 	 - 0..n associations are not supported yet
     * 	 - for events either a function (event handler) is accepted or an array of length 2 where the first
     * 			element is a function and the 2nd element is an object to invoke the method on.
     *
     * Special aggregation `dependents` is connected to the lifecycle management and databinding, but not rendered
     * automatically and can be used for popups or other dependent controls or elements. This allows the definition
     * of popup controls in declarative views and enables propagation of model and context information to them.
     *

     *
     * Each `Element` must have an ID. If no `sId` or `mSettings.id` is given at construction time, a new ID
     * will be created automatically. The IDs of all elements that exist at the same time in the same window
     * must be different. Providing an ID which is already used by another element throws an error.
     *
     * When an element is created from a declarative source (e.g. XMLView), then an ID defined in that declarative
     * source needs to be unique only within the declarative source. Declarative views will prefix that ID with
     * their own ID (and some separator) before constructing the element. Programmatically created views (JSViews)
     * can do the same with the {@link sap.ui.core.mvc.View#createId} API. Similarly, UIComponents can prefix

     * Settings: If the optional `mSettings` are given, they must be a JSON-like object (object literal) that
     * defines values for properties, aggregations, associations or events keyed by their name.
     *
     * **Valid Names:**
     *
     * The property (key) names supported in the object literal are exactly the (case sensitive) names documented
     * in the JSDoc for the properties, aggregations, associations and events of the control and its base classes.
     * Note that for 0..n aggregations and associations this usually is the plural name, whereas it is the singular
     * name in case of 0..1 relations.
     *
     * Each subclass should document the set of supported names in its constructor documentation.
     *
     * **Valid Values:**
     *
     *
     * 	 - for normal properties, the value has to be of the correct simple type (no type conversion occurs)
     *
     * 	 - for 0..1 aggregations, the value has to be an instance of the aggregated control or element type
     *
     * 	 - for 0..n aggregations, the value has to be an array of instances of the aggregated type
     * 	 - for 0..1 associations, an instance of the associated type or an id (string) is accepted
     * 	 - 0..n associations are not supported yet
     * 	 - for events either a function (event handler) is accepted or an array of length 2 where the first
     * 			element is a function and the 2nd element is an object to invoke the method on.
     *
     * Special aggregation `dependents` is connected to the lifecycle management and databinding, but not rendered
     * automatically and can be used for popups or other dependent controls or elements. This allows the definition
     * of popup controls in declarative views and enables propagation of model and context information to them.

     * Delegates are simple objects that can have an arbitrary number of event handler methods. See the section
     * "Handling of Events" in the {@link #constructor} documentation to learn how events will be dispatched
     * and how event handler methods have to be named to be found.
     *
     * If multiple delegates are registered for the same element, they will be called in the order of their
     * registration. Double registrations are prevented. Before a delegate is added, all registrations of the
     * same delegate (no matter what value for `oThis` was used for their registration) are removed and only
     * then the delegate is added. Note that this might change the position of the delegate in the list of delegates.
     *
     * When an element is cloned, all its event delegates will be added to the clone. This behavior is well-suited
     * for applications which want to add delegates that also work with templates in aggregation bindings. For
     * control development, the internal `addDelegate` method may be more suitable. Delegates added via that
     * method are not cloned automatically, as typically each control instance takes care of adding its own
     * delegates.
     *
     * **Important:** If event delegates were added, the delegate will still be called even if the event was
     * processed and/or cancelled via `preventDefault` by the Element or another event delegate. `preventDefault`
     * only prevents the event from bubbling. It should be checked e.g. in the event delegate's listener whether
     * an Element is still enabled via `getEnabled`. Additionally there might be other things that delegates
     * need to check depending on the event (e.g. not adding a key twice to an output string etc.).

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.60
   *
   * This class provides methods for evaluating the possibility of using browser-native hyphenation or initializing
   * and using a third-party hyphenation module.
   *
   * Overview: By using this API, a developer can check if browser-native hyphenation is supported for a particular
   * language.
   *
   * When browser-native hyphenation is not supported or if otherwise required, the API can be used to hyphenate
   * texts. A third-party library "Hyphenopoly" is used in that case.
   *
   * It is used internally by controls that support the `wrappingType:{@link sap.m.WrappingType WrappingType.Hyphenated}`
   * property.
   *
   * As the class is singleton, an instance should be acquired from {@link sap.ui.core.hyphenation.Hyphenation.getInstance
   * Hyphenation.getInstance}.
   *
   * Usage: When to use::
   * 	 - To check if browser-native hyphenation is available for particular language.
   * 	 - To hyphenate texts if browser-native hyphenation is not available.  When not to use::
   * 	 -  If the use case is covered by controls that support the property `wrappingType:{@link sap.m.WrappingType
   * 			WrappingType.Hyphenated}`. This functionality is supported by {@link sap.m.Title sap.m.Title}, {@link
   * 			sap.m.Label sap.m.Label} and {@link sap.m.Text sap.m.Text}.
   * 	 - If browser-native hyphenation is available
   *
   * Example:
   * ```javascript
   *
   * if (!Hyphenation.getInstance().canUseNativeHyphenation("en")) {
   * 	Hyphenation.getInstance().initialize("en").then(function() {
   * 		console.log(Hyphenation.getInstance().hyphenate("An example text to hyphenate.", "en"));
   * 	});
   * }
   * ```
   *
   *
   * For more information, see {@link topic:6322164936f047de941ec522b95d7b70 Hyphenation for Text Controls}.
   *
   * `Caution:` Note that as the hyphenation feature uses third-party and browser-native tools, we are not
   * responsible for any grammatical incorrectness or inconsistencies of the hyphenation. Also, the variety
   * of supported languages is outside the scope of our control and may be subject to future changes.

   * Introduces the relationship to a Controller, some basic visual appearance settings like width and height,
   * and provides lifecycle events.
   *
   * Views form an ID scope for the elements and controls in their content. They can prefix the IDs of elements
   * either automatically (e.g. XMLView) or programmatically (using {@link #createId}). With method {@link
   * #byId}, elements or controls can be found with their view-local ID. Also see {@link topic:91f28be26f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070
   * "Support for Unique IDs"} in the documentation.
   *
   * **Note: For Views defined using XML markup** On root level, you can only define content for the default
   * aggregation, e.g. without adding the `<content>` tag. If you want to specify content for another
   * aggregation of a view like `dependents`, place it in a child control's dependents aggregation or add
   * it by using {@link sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView.addDependent}.
   *
   * View Definition: A view can be defined by {@link sap.ui.core.mvc.View.extend extending} this class and
   * implementing the {@link #createContent} method. The method must return one or many root controls that
   * will be rendered as content of the view.
   *
   * Views that are defined that way are referred to as **typed views**, as each view definition is represented
   * by its own class (type). See {@link topic:e6bb33d076dc4f23be50c082c271b9f0 Typed Views} for further information.
   *
   * **Example:** Defining a typed view (module 'myapp/views/MainView.js')
   * ```javascript
   *
   *   // view definition
   *   sap.ui.define([
   *     "sap/ui/core/mvc/View",
   *     "sap/m/Panel"
   *   ], function(View, Panel) {
   *
   *     return View.extend("myapp.views.MainView", {
   *
   *       // define, which controller to use
   *       getControllerName: function() {
   *         return "myapp.controller.Main";
   *       },
   *
   *       // whether the ID of content controls should be prefixed automatically with the view's ID
   *       getAutoPrefixId: function() {
   *         return true; // default is false
   *       }
   *
   *       // create view content and return the root control(s)
   *       // or a Promise resolving with the control(s).
   *       createContent: function() {
   *         return new Promise(function(res, rej) {
   *             res(new Panel({...}));
   *         }).catch(function(err) {
   *             rej(err);
   *         });
   *       }
   *     });
   *   });
   * ```
   *
   *
   * View Instantiation: The preferred way of instantiating a typed view is via the generic factory {@link
   * sap.ui.core.mvc.View.create View.create}.
   *
   * When the `viewName` starts with prefix `"module:"`, the remainder of the name is assumed to be the name
   * of a module that exports a typed view (a subclass of `View`). The module name must use the same syntax
   * as for `sap.ui.define/sap.ui.require` (slash-separated name without '.js' suffix).
   *
   * **Example:** Instantiating a typed view with `View.create`
   * ```javascript
   *
   *   View.create({
   *     viewName: "module:myapp/views/MainView"
   *   }).then(oView) {
   *     oView.placeAt("content");
   *   });
   * ```
   *
   *
   * A typed view can also be instantiated by calling its constructor without any arguments:
   * ```javascript
   *
   *   sap.ui.require(["myapp/views/MainView"], function(MainView) {
   *     new MainView().placeAt("content");
   *   });
   * ```
   *
   *
   * Other Methods: Besides `createContent`, there are two other methods that a view can implement: Method
   * {@link #getControllerName getControllerName} defines the name of the controller that should be instantiated
   * and used for the view. The name must be in class name notation (dot notation), without the `".controller"`
   * suffix. The suffix will be added by the framework when loading the module containing the controller.
   *
   * {@link #getAutoPrefixId getAutoPrefixId} defines whether the IDs of controls created during the execution
   * of `createContent` will be prefixed with the ID of the view automatically. The default implementation
   * of this method returns `false`.

  /**
   * Popup Class is a helper class for controls that want themselves or parts of themselves or even other
   * aggregated or composed controls or plain HTML content to popup on the screen like menus, dialogs, drop
   * down boxes.
   *
   * It allows the controls to be aligned to other DOM elements using the {@link sap.ui.core.Popup.Dock} method.
   * With it you can define where the popup should be docked. One can dock the popup to the top, bottom, left
   * or right side of another DOM element.
   *
   * In the case that the popup has no space to show itself in the view port of the current window, it tries
   * to open itself to the inverted direction.
   *
   * **Since 1.12.3**, it is possible to add further DOM-element-IDs that can get the focus when `autoclose`
   * or `modal` is enabled. E.g. the `RichTextEditor` with running TinyMCE uses this method to be able to
   * focus the popups of the TinyMCE if the `RichTextEditor` runs within a `Popup`/`Dialog` etc.
   *
   * To provide an additional DOM element that can get the focus the following should be done:
   * ```javascript
   *
   *   // create an object with the corresponding DOM-ID
   *   var oObject = {
   *     id : "this_is_the_most_valuable_id_of_the_DOM_element"
   *   };
   *
   *   // add the event prefix for adding an element to the ID of the corresponding Popup
   *   var sEventId = "sap.ui.core.Popup.addFocusableContent-" + oPopup.getId();
   *
   *   // fire the event with the created event-ID and the object with the DOM-ID
   *   sap.ui.getCore().getEventBus().publish("sap.ui", sEventId, oObject);
   * ```
   *
   *
   * **Since 1.75**, DOM elements which have the attribute `data-sap-ui-integration-popup-content` are considered
   * to be part of all opened popups. Those DOM elements can get the focus without causing the autoclose popup
   * to be closed or the modal popup to take the focus back to itself. Additionally, a further DOM query selector
   * can be provided by using {@link sap.ui.core.Popup.addExternalContent} to make the DOM elements which
   * match the selector be considered as part of all opened popups. Please be aware that the Popup implementation
   * only checks if a DOM element is marked with the attribute `data-sap-ui-integration-popup-content`. The
   * actual attribute value is not checked. To prevent a DOM element from matching, you must remove the attribute
   * itself. Setting the attribute to a falsy value is not enough in this case.

   * Base Class for a Renderer.
   */
  interface Renderer {
    /**
     * Creates a new renderer that extends a given renderer.
     *
     * This method can be used with two signatures that are explained below. In both variants, the returned
     * renderer inherits all properties (methods, fields) from the given parent renderer. Both variants also
     * add an 'extend' method to the created renderer that behaves like the modern signature variant of this
     * `Renderer.extend` method, but allows to extend the new renderer instead of `sap.ui.core.Renderer`.
     *
     * Modern Signature:
     *
     * In the modern signature variant, two parameters must be given: a qualified name for the new renderer
     * (its global name, in dot-notation), and an optional object literal that contains methods or fields to
     * be added to the new renderer class.
     *
     * This signature has been designed to resemble the class extension mechanism as provided by {@link sap.ui.base.Object.extend
     * Object.extend}.
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     * sap.ui.define(['sap/ui/core/Renderer'],
     *     function(Renderer) {
     *     "use strict";
     *
     *     var LabelRenderer = Renderer.extend('sap.m.LabelRenderer', {
     *         render: function(oRM, oControl) {
     *
     *             renderPreamble(oRM, oControl);
     *
     *             // implementation core renderer logic here
     *
     *             renderPostamble(oRM, oControl);
     *
     *         },
     *
     *         renderPreamble : function(oRM, oControl) {
     *         ...
     *         },
     *
     *         renderPostamble : function(oRM, oControl) {
     *         ...
     *         }
     *
     *     });
     *
     *     return LabelRenderer;
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * The extension of renderers works across multiple levels. A `FancyLabelRenderer` can extend the above
     * `LabelRenderer`:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     * sap.ui.define(['sap/m/LabelRenderer'],
     *     function(LabelRenderer) {
     *     "use strict";
     *
     *     var FancyLabelRenderer = LabelRenderer.extend('sap.mylib.FancyLabelRenderer', {
     *         render: function(oRM, oControl) {
     *
     *             // call base renderer
     *             LabelRenderer.renderPreamble(oRM, oControl);
     *
     *             // ... do your own fancy rendering here
     *
     *             // call base renderer again
     *             LabelRenderer.renderPostamble(oRM, oControl);
     *         }
     *     });
     *
     *     return FancyLabelRenderer;
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * **Note:** The modern signature no longer requires the `bExport` flag to be set for the enclosing {@link
     * sap.ui.define} call. The Renderer base class takes care of the necessary global export of the renderer.
     * This allows non-SAP developers to write a renderer that complies with the documented restriction for
     * `sap.ui.define` (no use of bExport = true outside sap.ui.core projects).
     *
     * Deprecated Signature:
     *
     * The deprecated old signature expects just one parameter: a renderer that should be extended. With that
     * signature, the renderer can't be exported globally as the name of the renderer class is not known.
     *
     * For compatibility reasons, the class created by the deprecated signature contains a property `_super`
     * that references the parent class. It shouldn't be used by applications / control developers as it doesn't
     * work reliably for deeper inheritance chains: if the old variant of `Renderer.extend` is used on two or
     * more levels of the inheritance hierarchy, the `_super` property of the resulting renderer class will
     * always point to the implementation of the base renderer of the last call to extend. Instead of using
     * `this._super`, renderer implementations should use the new signature variant and access the base implementation
     * of a method via the AMD reference to the base renderer (as shown in the FancyLabelRenderer example above).
     *
     * Use as a Generic Method:
     *
     * Only renderers that have been created with a call to `extend` will get their own `extend` method to create
     * new subclasses. To allow extending from older renderers that have been written from scratch as a plain
     * object, the `Renderer.extend` method can be called as a generic method, providing the base renderer
     * as `this`.
     *
     * Example: Derive from `HBoxRenderer` (which is assumed to be a plain object)
     * ```javascript
     *
     * sap.ui.define(['sap/ui/core/Renderer', 'sap/m/HBoxRenderer'],
     *     function(Renderer, HBoxRenderer) {
     *     "use strict";
     *
     *     // Call 'extend' as a generic method, providing the HBoxRenderer as 'this'
     *     var MyRenderer = Renderer.extend.call(HBoxRenderer, 'sap.m.LabelRenderer', {
     *
     *         someOverriddenHook: function(oRM, oControl) {
     *         ...
     *         },
     *
     *     });
     *
     *     return LabelRenderer;
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *

  /**
   * A class that handles the rendering of controls.
   *
   * For the default rendering task of UI5, a shared RenderManager is created and owned by `sap.ui.core.Core`.
   * Controls or other code that want to render controls outside the default rendering task can create a private
   * instance of RenderManager by calling the {@link sap.ui.core.Core#createRenderManager sap.ui.getCore().createRenderManager()}
   * method. When such a private instance is no longer needed, it should be {@link #destroy destroyed}.
   *
   * Control renderers only have access to a subset of the public and protected instance methods of this class.
   * The instance methods {@link #flush}, {@link #render} and {@link #destroy} are not part of that subset
   * and are reserved to the owner of the corresponding RenderManager instance. Renderers will use the provided
   * methods to create their HTML output. The RenderManager will collect the HTML output and inject the final
   * HTML DOM at the desired location.
   *
   * Renderers: When the {@link #renderControl} method of the RenderManager is invoked, it will retrieve the
   * default renderer for that control. By convention, the default renderer is implemented in its own namespace
   * (static class) which matches the name of the control's class with the additional suffix 'Renderer'. So
   * for a control `sap.m.Input` the default renderer will be searched for under the global name `sap.m.InputRenderer`.
   *
   * Semantic Rendering: As of 1.67, `RenderManager` provides a set of new APIs to describe the structure
   * of the DOM that can be used by the control renderers.
   *
   *
   * ```javascript
   *
   *
   *   myButtonRenderer.render = function(rm, oButton) {
   *
   *       rm.openStart("button", oButton);
   *       rm.attr("tabindex", 1);
   *       rm.class("myButton");
   *       rm.style("width", oButton.getWidth());
   *       rm.openEnd();
   *           rm.text(oButton.getText());
   *       rm.close("button");
   *
   *   };
   *
   * ```
   *
   *
   * By default, when the control is invalidated (e.g. a property is changed, an aggregation is removed, or
   * an association is added), it will be registered for re-rendering. During the (re)rendering, the `render`
   * method of the control renderer is executed via a specified `RenderManager` interface and the control
   * instance.
   *
   * Traditional string-based rendering creates a new HTML structure of the control in every rendering cycle
   * and removes the existing control DOM structure from the DOM tree.
   *
   * The set of new semantic `RenderManager` APIs lets us understand the structure of the DOM, walk along
   * the live DOM tree, and figure out changes as new APIs are called. If there is a change, then `RenderManager`
   * patches only the required parts of the live DOM tree. This allows control developers to remove their
   * DOM-related custom setters.
   *
   * **Note:** To enable the new in-place rendering technology, the `apiVersion` property of the control renderer
   * must be set to `2`. This property is not inherited by subclass renderers. It has to be set anew by each
   * subclass to assure that the extended contract between framework and renderer is fulfilled (see next paragraph).
   *
   *
   * ```javascript
   *
   *
   *   var myButtonRenderer = {
   *       apiVersion: 2    // enable semantic rendering
   *   };
   *
   *   myButtonRenderer.render = function(rm, oButton) {
   *
   *       rm.openStart("button", oButton);
   *       ...
   *       ...
   *       rm.close("button");
   *
   *   };
   *
   * ```
   *
   *
   * Contract for Renderer.apiVersion 2: To allow a more efficient in-place DOM patching and to ensure the
   * compatibility of the control, the following prerequisites must be fulfilled for the controls using the
   * new rendering technology:
   *
   *
   * 	 - Legacy control renderers must be migrated to the new semantic renderer API: {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#openStart
   * 			openStart}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#voidStart voidStart}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#style
   * 			style}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#class class}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#attr attr}, {@link
   * 			sap.ui.core.RenderManager#openEnd openEnd}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#voidEnd voidEnd}, {@link
   * 			sap.ui.core.RenderManager#text text}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#unsafeHtml unsafeHtml}, {@link
   * 			sap.ui.core.RenderManager#icon icon}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#accessibilityState accessibilityState},
   * 			{@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#renderControl renderControl}, {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#cleanupControlWithoutRendering
   * 			cleanupControlWithoutRendering}
   * 	 - During the migration, restrictions that are defined in the API documentation of those methods must
   * 			be taken into account, e.g. tag and attribute names must be set in their canonical form.
   * 	 - Fault tolerance of HTML5 markup is not applicable for the new semantic rendering API, e.g. except
   * 			void tags, all tags must be closed; duplicate attributes within one HTML element must not exist.
   * 	 - Existing control DOM structure will not be removed from the DOM tree; therefore all custom events,
   * 			including the ones that are registered with jQuery, must be de-registered correctly at the `onBeforeRendering`
   * 			and `exit` hooks.
   * 	 - Classes and attribute names must not be escaped.
   * 	 - Styles should be validated via types (e.g. `sap.ui.core.CSSSize`). But this might not be sufficient
   * 			in all cases, e.g. validated URL values can contain harmful content; in this case {@link module:sap/base/security/encodeCSS
   * 			encodeCSS} can be used.
   * 	 - To allow a more efficient DOM update, second parameter of the {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#openStart
   * 			openStart} or {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#voidStart voidStart} methods must be used to identify
   * 			elements, e.g. use `rm.openStart("div", oControl.getId() + "-suffix");` instead of `rm.openStart("div").attr("id",
   * 			oControl.getId() + "-suffix");`
   * 	 - Controls that listen to the `focusin` event must double check their focus handling. Since DOM nodes
   * 			are not removed and only reused, the `focusin` event might not be fired during re-rendering.

     * are only rendered when the accessibility feature is activated in the UI5 runtime configuration.
     *
     * The values for the attributes are collected from the following sources (last one wins):
     * 	 - from the properties and associations of the given `oElement`, using a heuristic mapping (described
     * 			below)
     * 	 - from the `mProps` parameter, as provided by the caller
     * 	 - from the parent of the given `oElement`, if it has a parent and if the parent implements the method
     * 			{@link sap.ui.core.Element#enhanceAccessibilityState enhanceAccessibilityState}  If no `oElement`
     * 			is given, only `mProps` will be taken into account.
     *
     * Heuristic Mapping: The following mapping from properties/values to ARIA attributes is used (if the element
     * does have such properties):
     * 	 - `editable===false` => `aria-readonly="true"`
     * 	 - `enabled===false` => `aria-disabled="true"`
     * 	 - `visible===false` => `aria-hidden="true"`
     * 	 - `required===true` => `aria-required="true"`
     * 	 - `selected===true` => `aria-selected="true"`
     * 	 - `checked===true` => `aria-checked="true"`
     *
     * In case of the `required` property, all label controls which reference the given element in their `labelFor`
     * relation are additionally taken into account when determining the value for the `aria-required` attribute.
     *
     * Additionally, the associations `ariaDescribedBy` and `ariaLabelledBy` are used to determine the lists
     * of IDs for the ARIA attributes `aria-describedby` and `aria-labelledby`.
     *
     * Label controls that reference the given element in their `labelFor` relation are automatically added
     * to the `aria-labelledby` attribute.
     *
     * Note: This function is only a heuristic of a control property to ARIA attribute mapping. Control developers
     * have to check whether it fulfills their requirements. In case of problems (for example the `RadioButton`
     * has a `selected` property but must provide an `aria-checked` attribute) the auto-generated result of
     * this function can be influenced via the parameter `mProps` as described below.
     *
     * The parameter `mProps` can be used to either provide additional attributes which should be rendered and/or
     * to avoid the automatic generation of single ARIA attributes. The 'aria-' prefix will be prepended automatically
     * to the keys (Exception: Attribute `role` does not get the prefix 'aria-').
     *
     * Examples:
     *  `{hidden : true}` results in `aria-hidden="true"` independent of the presence or absence of the visibility
     * property.
     *  `{hidden : null}` ensures that no `aria-hidden` attribute is written independent of the presence or
     * absence of the visibility property.
     *
     *
     * The function behaves in the same way for the associations `ariaDescribedBy` and `ariaLabelledBy`. To
     * append additional values to the auto-generated `aria-describedby` and `aria-labelledby` attributes, the
     * following format can be used:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   {describedby : {value: "id1 id2", append: true}} =>  aria-describedby = "ida idb id1 id2"
     * ```
     *  (assuming that "ida idb" is the auto-generated part based on the association `ariaDescribedBy`).

     * Cleans up the rendering state of the given control without rendering it.
     *
     * A control is responsible for the rendering of all its child controls. But in some cases it makes sense
     * that a control only renders a subset of its children based on some criterion. For example, a typical
     * carousel control might, for performance reasons, only render the currently visible children (and maybe
     * some child before and after the visible area to facilitate slide-in / slide-out animations), but not
     * all children. This leads to situations where a child had been rendered before, but shouldn't be rendered
     * anymore after an update of the carousel's position. The DOM related state of that child then must be
     * cleaned up correctly, e.g. by de-registering resize handlers or native event handlers. `cleanupControlWithoutRendering`
     * helps with that task by triggering the same activities that the normal rendering triggers before the
     * rendering of a control (e.g. it fires the `BeforeRendering` event). It just doesn't call the renderer
     * and the control will not receive an `AfterRendering` event.
     *
     * The following example shows how `renderControl` and `cleanupControlWithoutRendering` should be used:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   CarouselRenderer.render = function(rm, oCarousel){
     *
     *     ...
     *
     *     oCarousel.getPages().forEach( function( oPage ) {
     *        if ( oCarousel.isPageToBeRendered( oPage ) ) {
     *           rm.renderControl( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering, render, later onAfterRendering
     *        } else {
     *           rm.cleanupControlWithoutRendering( oPage ); // onBeforeRendering
     *        }
     *     });
     *
     *     ...
     *
     *   };
     * ```
     *
     *
     * DOM Removal: The method does not remove the DOM of the given control. The caller of this method has to
     * take care to remove it at some later point in time. It should indeed be later, not before
     * as the `onBeforeRendering` hook of the control might need access to the old DOM for a proper cleanup.
     *
     * For parents which are rendered with the normal mechanism as shown in the example above, the removal of
     * the old child DOM is guaranteed. The whole DOM of the parent control (including the DOM of the no longer
     * rendered child) will be replaced with new DOM (no longer containing the child) when the rendering cycle
     * finishes.
     *
     * **Note:**: the functionality of this method is different from the default handling for invisible controls
     * (controls with `visible == false`). The standard rendering for invisible controls still renders a placeholder
     * DOM. This allows re-rendering of the invisible control once it becomes visible again without a need to
     * render its parent, too. Children that are cleaned up with this method here, are supposed to have no more
     * DOM at all. Rendering them later on therefore requires an involvement (typically: a rendering) of their
     * parent.

     * @deprecated (since 1.92) - Instead use {@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#accessibilityState} of the {@link

     *
     * Collects accessibility related attributes for an `Element` and renders them as part of the currently
     * rendered DOM element.
     *
     * See the WAI-ARIA specification for a general description of the accessibility related attributes. Attributes
     * are only rendered when the accessibility feature is activated in the UI5 runtime configuration.
     *
     * The values for the attributes are collected from the following sources (last one wins):
     * 	 - from the properties and associations of the given `oElement`, using a heuristic mapping (described
     * 			below)
     * 	 - from the `mProps` parameter, as provided by the caller
     * 	 - from the parent of the given `oElement`, if it has a parent and if the parent implements the method
     * 			{@link sap.ui.core.Element#enhanceAccessibilityState enhanceAccessibilityState}  If no `oElement`
     * 			is given, only `mProps` will be taken into account.
     *
     * Heuristic Mapping: The following mapping from properties/values to ARIA attributes is used (if the element
     * does have such properties):
     * 	 - `editable===false` => `aria-readonly="true"`
     * 	 - `enabled===false` => `aria-disabled="true"`
     * 	 - `visible===false` => `aria-hidden="true"`
     * 	 - `required===true` => `aria-required="true"`
     * 	 - `selected===true` => `aria-selected="true"`
     * 	 - `checked===true` => `aria-checked="true"`
     *
     * In case of the `required` property, all label controls which reference the given element in their `labelFor`
     * relation are additionally taken into account when determining the value for the `aria-required` attribute.
     *
     * Additionally, the associations `ariaDescribedBy` and `ariaLabelledBy` are used to determine the lists
     * of IDs for the ARIA attributes `aria-describedby` and `aria-labelledby`.
     *
     * Label controls that reference the given element in their `labelFor` relation are automatically added
     * to the `aria-labelledby` attributes.
     *
     * Note: This function is only a heuristic of a control property to ARIA attribute mapping. Control developers
     * have to check whether it fulfills their requirements. In case of problems (for example the `RadioButton`
     * has a `selected` property but must provide an `aria-checked` attribute) the auto-generated result of
     * this function can be influenced via the parameter `mProps` as described below.
     *
     * The parameter `mProps` can be used to either provide additional attributes which should be rendered and/or
     * to avoid the automatic generation of single ARIA attributes. The 'aria-' prefix will be prepended automatically
     * to the keys (Exception: Attribute `role` does not get the prefix 'aria-').
     *
     * Examples:
     *  `{hidden : true}` results in `aria-hidden="true"` independent of the presence or absence of the visibility
     * property.
     *  `{hidden : null}` ensures that no `aria-hidden` attribute is written independent of the presence or
     * absence of the visibility property.
     *
     *
     * The function behaves in the same way for the associations `ariaDescribedBy` and `ariaLabelledBy`. To
     * append additional values to the auto-generated `aria-describedby` and `aria-labelledby` attributes, the
     * following format can be used:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   {describedby : {value: "id1 id2", append: true}} =>  aria-describedby = "ida idb id1 id2"
     * ```
     *  (assuming that "ida idb" is the auto-generated part based on the association `ariaDescribedBy`).

           * of it.
           *  **Example app structure:**
           *  We have a rootView that is returned by the createContent function of our UIComponent. This view contains

           * ```javascript
           *
           *
           * <View xmlns="sap.m">
           *     <App id="myApp"/>
           * </View>
           *
           * ```
           *  an xml view called 'Detail'
           * ```javascript
           *
           *
           * <View xmlns="sap.m">
           *     <IconTabBar>
           *         <items>
           *             <IconTabFilter>
           *                 <!-- content of our first tab -->
           *             <IconTabFilter>
           *             <IconTabFilter id="mySecondTab">
           *                 <!-- nothing here, since we will lazy load this one with a target -->
           *             <IconTabFilter>
           *         </items>
           *     </IconTabBar>
           * </View>
           *
           * ```
           *  and a view called 'SecondTabContent', this one contains our content we want to have lazy loaded. Now
           * we need to create our Targets instance with a config matching our app:
           * ```javascript
           *
           *
           *     new Targets({
           *         //Creates our views except for root, we created this one before - when using a component you
           *         views: new Views(),
           *         config: {
           *             // all of our views have that type
           *             viewType: 'XML',
           *             // a reference to the app control in the rootView created by our UIComponent
           *             controlId: 'myApp',
           *             // An app has a pages aggregation where the views need to be put into

           *             },
           *             secondTabContent: {
           *                 // A reference to the detail target defined above
           *                 parent: 'detail',
           *                 // A reference to the second Tab container in the Detail view. Here the target does not look in the rootView, it looks in the Parent view (Detail).
           *                 controlId: 'mySecondTab',
           *                 // An IconTabFilter has an aggregation called content so we need to overwrite the pages set in the config as default.
           *                 controlAggregation: 'content',
           *                 // A view containing the content
           *                 type: "View",
           *                 name: 'SecondTabContent'
           *             }
           *         }
           *     });
           *
           * ```
           *
           *
           * Now if we call ` oTargets.display("secondTabContent") `, 2 views will be created: Detail and SecondTabContent.
           * The 'Detail' view will be put into the pages aggregation of the App. And afterwards the 'SecondTabContent'
           * view will be put into the content Aggregation of the second IconTabFilter. So a parent will always be
           * created before the target referencing it.

   * An area in a page that hosts a tree of UI elements.
   *
   * `UIArea`s are fully managed by the UI5 {@link sap.ui.core.Core Core}. They cannot be created by the application
   * but are implicitly created by the Core when controls are placed via {@link sap.ui.core.Control#placeAt
   * Control#placeAt} at a new DOM element for which no `UIArea` exists yet.
   *
   * `UIArea`s are essential for the rendering of controls. Controls get rendered only when they are directly
   * or indirectly contained in the `content` aggregation of a `UIArea`. `Control#placeAt` ensures that there
   * is a `UIArea` with the given ID and adds the control to the `content` aggregation of this `UIArea`. Whenever
   * controls become invalidated, the corresponding `UIArea` remembers this and takes care of the re-rendering
   * of the control.
   *
   * Additionally, `UIArea`s play an important role in the event handling of controls. They register for a
   * standard set of browser events. For each incoming event, they identify the control to which the target
   * of the event belongs to and dispatch the event to that control. This dispatching reduces the number of
   * event handlers in a page.
   *
   * `UIArea`s also act as a data binding root for their contained controls. Whenever a model is attached
   * to or detached from the Core, this change is propagated to all `UIAreas` which in turn propagate it further
   * down to their aggregated children, etc.
   *
   * The special aggregation named `dependents` also participates in the databinding, but its content is not
   * rendered by the `UIArea`. It can be used for popups or similar controls that are not contained in the
   * normal control tree, but nevertheless should receive model or binding context updates.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.27.1
   *
   * Context interface provided by XML template processing as an additional first argument to any formatter
   * function which opts in to this mechanism. Candidates for such formatter functions are all those used
   * in binding expressions which are evaluated during XML template processing, including those used inside
   * template instructions like `<template:if>`. The formatter function needs to be marked with a property
   * `requiresIContext = true` to express that it requires this extended signature (compared to ordinary formatter
   * functions). The usual arguments are provided after the first one (currently: the raw value from the model).
   *
   * This interface provides callback functions to access the model and path which are needed to process OData
   * V4 annotations. It initially offers a subset of methods from {@link sap.ui.model.Context} so that formatters
   * might also be called with a context object for convenience, e.g. outside of XML template processing (see
   * below for an exception to this rule).
   *
   * **Example:** Suppose you have a formatter function called "foo" like below and it is used within an XML
   * template like `<template:if test="{path: '...', formatter: 'foo'}">`. In this case `foo` is called
   * with arguments `oInterface, vRawValue` such that `oInterface.getModel().getObject(oInterface.getPath())
   * === vRawValue` holds.
   * ```javascript
   *
   * window.foo = function (oInterface, vRawValue) {
   *     //TODO ...
   * };
   * window.foo.requiresIContext = true;
   * ```
   *
   *
   * **Composite Binding Examples:** Suppose you have the same formatter function and it is used in a composite
   * binding like `<Text text="{path: 'Label', formatter: 'foo'}: {path: 'Value', formatter: 'foo'}"/>`.
   * In this case `oInterface.getPath()` refers to ".../Label" in the 1st call and ".../Value" in the 2nd
   * call. This means each formatter call knows which part of the composite binding it belongs to and behaves
   * just as if it was an ordinary binding.
   *
   * Suppose your formatter is not used within a part of the composite binding, but at the root of the composite
   * binding in order to aggregate all parts like ` <Text text="{parts: [{path: 'Label'}, {path: 'Value'}],
   * formatter: 'foo'}"/>`. In this case `oInterface.getPath(0)` refers to ".../Label" and `oInterface.getPath(1)`
   * refers to ".../Value". This means, the root formatter can access the ith part of the composite binding
   * at will (since 1.31.0); see also {@link #.getInterface getInterface}. The function `foo` is called with
   * arguments such that ` oInterface.getModel(i).getObject(oInterface.getPath(i)) === arguments[i + 1]` holds.
   *
   * To distinguish those two use cases, just check whether `oInterface.getModel() === undefined`, in which
   * case the formatter is called on root level of a composite binding. To find out the number of parts, probe
   * for the smallest non-negative integer where `oInterface.getModel(i) === undefined`. This additional functionality
   * is, of course, not available from {@link sap.ui.model.Context}, i.e. such formatters MUST be called with
   * an instance of this context interface.

  export default class XMLComposite extends Control {
    /**
     * XMLComposite is the base class for composite controls that use a XML fragment representation for their
     * visual parts. From a user perspective such controls appear as any other control, but internally the rendering
     * part is added as a fragment. The fragment that is used should appear in the same folder as the control's
     * JS implementation with the file extension `.control.xml`. The fragment's content can access the interface
     * data from the XMLComposite control via bindings. Currently only aggregations and properties can be used
     * with bindings inside a fragment. The exposed model that is used for internal bindings in the fragment
     * has the default name `$this`. The name will always start with an `$`. The metadata of the derived control
     * can define the alias with its metadata. A code example can be found below.
     *
     * As XMLComposites compose other controls, they are only invalidated and re-rendered if explicitly defined.
     * Additional metadata for invalidation can be given for properties and aggregation. The default invalidation
     * is `"none"`. Setting invalidate to `true` for properties and aggregations sets the complete XMLComposite
     * to invalidate and rerender.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * XMLComposite.extend("sap.mylib.MyXMLComposite", {
     *   metadata : {
     *     library: "sap.mylib",
     *     properties : {
     *       text: { //changing this property will not re-render the XMLComposite
     *          type: "string",
     *          defaultValue: ""
     *       },
     *       title: { //changing this property will re-render the XMLComposite as it defines invalidate: true
     *          type: "string",
     *          defaultValue: "",
     *          invalidate: true
     *       },
     *       value: { //changing this property will re-render the XMLComposite as it defines invalidate: true
     *          type: "string",
     *          defaultValue: "",
     *          invalidate: true
     *       }
     *     },
     *     defaultProperty : "text",
     *     aggregations : {
     *       items : {
     *          type: "sap.ui.core.Control",
     *          invalidate: true
     *       },
     *       header : {
     *          type: "sap.mylib.FancyHeader",
     *          multiple : false
     *       }
     *     },
     *     defaultAggregation : "items"
     *     events: {
     *       outerEvent : {
     *         parameters : {
     *           opener : "sap.ui.core.Control"
     *         }
     *       }
     *     }
     *   },
     *   //alias defaults to "this"
     *   alias: "mycontrolroot" //inner bindings will use model name $mycontrolroot
     *   //fragment defaults to {control name}.control.xml in this case sap.mylib.MyXMLComposite.control.xml
     *   fragment: "sap.mylib.MyXMLCompositeOther.control.xml" //the name of the fragment
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Internally the XMLComposite instantiates and initializes the given fragment and stores the resulting
     * control in a hidden aggregation named `_content`. The fragment should only include one root element.
     *
     * Bindings of inner controls to the interface of the XMLComposite can be done with normal binding syntax.
     * Here properties are used as property bindings and aggregations are used as list bindings. Currently it
     * is not possible to bind associations in a fragment.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *    <core:FragmentDefinition xmlns:m="sap.m" xmlns:core="sap.ui.core">
     *       <m:Text text="{$this>text}" visible="{= ${$this>text} !== ""}" />
     *    </core:FragmentDefinition>
     * ```
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *    <core:FragmentDefinition xmlns:m="sap.m" xmlns:core="sap.ui.core">
     *       <m:VBox items="{path:"$this>texts", filters:{path:"text", operator:"Contains", value1:"Text"}, sorter:{path:"text", descending:true}}">
     *           <m:Text text="{$this>text}" />
     *       </m:VBox>
     *    </core:FragmentDefinition>
     * ```
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *    <core:FragmentDefinition xmlns:m="sap.m" xmlns:core="sap.ui.core">
     *       <m:Button text="Press Me" press="handlePress"/>
     *    </core:FragmentDefinition>
     * ```
     *
     *
     * All events handled within the fragment will be dispatched to the XMLComposite control. It is recommended
     * to follow this paradigm to allow reuse of a XMLComposite without any dependency to controller code of
     * the current embedding view.
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *    MyXMLComposite.prototype.handlePress = function() {
     *        this.fireOuterEvent(); // passing on the event to the outer view
     *    }
     * ```
     *
     *
     * **Note:** {@link topic:b11d853a8e784db6b2d210ef57b0f7d7 Requiring modules in XML} will result in side
     * effects that might cause the XMLComposite to not work properly. We suggest you require the needed modules
     * inside the JavaScript coding of the class extending the XMLComposite.

     * 	`boolean`, `number`, `undefined`: The part is a constant value.
     *
     * `string`: The part is a data binding expression with complex binding syntax (for example, as created
     * by {@link #.format format}) and is parsed accordingly to create either a constant value or a binding
     * info object. Proper backslash escaping must be used for constant values with curly braces.
     *
     * `object`: The part is a binding info object if it has a "path" or "parts" property, otherwise it
     * is a constant value.  If a binding info object is not the only part and has a "parts" property itself,
     * then it must have no other properties except "formatter"; this is the case for expression bindings and
     * data binding expressions created by {@link #.format format}.
     *
     * If all parts are constant values, the resulting property setting is also a constant value computed by
     * applying the root formatter function to the constant parts once. If at least one part is a binding info
     * object, the resulting property setting is also a binding info object and the root formatter function
     * will be applied again and again to the current values of all parts, no matter whether constant or variable.

     * is called.

     * "14.5.6 Expression edm:If": This is turned into an expression binding to be evaluated at run-time. The
     * expression is a conditional expression like `"{=condition ? expression1 : expression2}"`.  the dynamic
     * "14.5.10 Expression edm:Null": This is turned into a `null` value. In `odata.concat` it is ignored.
     * the dynamic "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path" and "14.5.13 Expression edm:PropertyPath": This is turned into
     * a data binding relative to an entity, including type information and constraints as available from metadata,
     * e.g. `"{path : 'Name', type : 'sap.ui.model.odata.type.String', constraints : {'maxLength':'255'}}"`.
     * Depending on the used type, some additional constraints of this type are set:
     * 	Edm.DateTime: The "displayFormat" constraint is set to the value of the "sap:display-format" annotation
     * of the referenced property. Edm.Decimal: The "precision" and "scale" constraints are set to the values
     * of the corresponding attributes of the referenced property. The "minimum", "maximum", "minimumExclusive"
     * and "maximumExlusive" constraints are set to the values of the corresponding "Org.OData.Validation.V1"
     * annotation of the referenced property; note that in this case only constant expressions are supported
     * to determine the annotation value. Edm.String: The "maxLength" constraint is set to the value of
     * the corresponding attribute of the referenced property and the "isDigitSequence" constraint is set to
     * the value of the "com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.IsDigitSequence" annotation of the referenced property;
     * note that in this case only constant expressions are supported to determine the annotation value.
     *  Unsupported or incorrect values are turned into a string nevertheless, but indicated as such. Proper
     * escaping is used to make sure that data binding syntax is not corrupted. An error describing the problem
     * is logged to the console in such a case.
     *
     * Example:

   * @SINCE 1.27.0
   *
   * Implementation of an OData meta model which offers a unified access to both OData V2 metadata and V4

   * V4 annotations from the existing {@link sap.ui.model.odata.ODataAnnotations} directly into the corresponding
   * model element.
   *
   * This model is not prepared to be inherited from.
   *
   * Also, annotations from the "http://www.sap.com/Protocols/SAPData" namespace are lifted up from the `extensions`
   * array and transformed from objects into simple properties with an "sap:" prefix for their name. Note
   * that this happens in addition, thus the following example shows both representations. This way, such
   * annotations can be addressed via a simple relative path instead of searching an array.
   * ```javascript
   *
   * 		{
   * 			"name" : "BusinessPartnerID",
   * 			"extensions" : [{
   * 				"name" : "label",
   * 				"value" : "Bus. Part. ID",

   * 			"sap:label" : "Bus. Part. ID"
   * 		}
   * ```
   *
   *
   * As of 1.29.0, the corresponding vocabulary-based annotations for the following "SAP
   * Annotations for OData Version 2.0" are added, if they are not yet defined in the V4 annotations:
   *
   * 	 - `label`;

   * 	 - `creatable` (since 1.41.0), `creatable-path` (since 1.41.0) and `filterable` (since 1.39.0) on navigation
   * 			properties;
   * 	 - `aggregation-role` ("dimension" and "measure", both since 1.45.0), `creatable`, `display-format`
   * 			("UpperCase" and "NonNegative"), `field-control`, `filterable`, `filter-restriction`, `heading`, `precision`,
   * 			`quickinfo`, `required-in-filter`, `sortable`, `text`, `unit`, `updatable` and `visible` on properties;
   *
   * 	 - `semantics`; the following values are supported:
   * 	"bday", "city", "country", "email" (including support for types, for example "email;type=home,pref"),

   * 			`com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.IsCalendar(Year|YearMonth|Date|YearQuarter|YearWeek)`);
   * 	 - "url" (mapped to V4 annotation `Org.OData.Core.V1.IsURL"`).   For example:
   * ```javascript
   *
   * 		{
   * 			"name" : "BusinessPartnerID",
   * 			...
   * 			"sap:label" : "Bus. Part. ID",
   * 			"com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label" : {
   * 				"String" : "Bus. Part. ID"
   * 			}
   * 		}
   * ```
   *  **Note:** Annotation terms are not merged, but replaced as a whole ("PUT" semantics). That means, if
   * you have, for example, an OData V2 annotation `sap:sortable=false` at a property `PropA`, the corresponding
   * OData V4 annotation is added to each entity set to which this property belongs:
   * ```javascript
   *
   * 		"Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.SortRestrictions": {
   * 			"NonSortableProperties" : [
   * 				{"PropertyPath" : "BusinessPartnerID"}
   * 			]
   * 		}
   * ```
   *  If the same term `"Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.SortRestrictions"` targeting one of these entity sets is
   * also contained in an annotation file, the complete OData V4 annotation converted from the OData V2 annotation
   * is replaced by the one contained in the annotation file for the specified target. Converted annotations
   * never use a qualifier and are only overwritten by the same annotation term without a qualifier.
   *
   * This model is read-only and thus only supports {@link sap.ui.model.BindingMode.OneTime OneTime} binding
   * mode. No events ({@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:parseError parseError}, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:requestCompleted
   * requestCompleted}, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:requestFailed requestFailed}, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#event:requestSent
   * requestSent}) are fired!
   *
   * Within the meta model, the objects are arranged in arrays. `/dataServices/schema`, for example, is an
   * array of schemas where each schema has an `entityType` property with an array of entity types, and so
   * on. So, `/dataServices/schema/0/entityType/16` can be the path to the entity type with name "Order" in
   * the schema with namespace "MySchema". However, these paths are not stable: If an entity type with lower
   * index is removed from the schema, the path to `Order` changes to `/dataServices/schema/0/entityType/15`.
   *
   * To avoid problems with changing indexes, {@link sap.ui.model.Model#getObject getObject} and {@link sap.ui.model.Model#getProperty
   * getProperty} support XPath-like queries for the indexes (since 1.29.1). Each index can be replaced by
   * a query in square brackets. You can, for example, address the schema using the path `/dataServices/schema/[${namespace}==='MySchema']`
   * or the entity using `/dataServices/schema/[${namespace}==='MySchema']/entityType/[${name}==='Order']`.
   *
   * The syntax inside the square brackets is the same as in expression binding. The query is executed for
   * each object in the array until the result is true (truthy) for the first time. This object is then chosen.
   *
   * **BEWARE:** Access to this OData meta model will fail before the promise returned by {@link #loaded loaded}
   * has been resolved!

     * 	 - Count Modes `Inline` or `InlineRepeat`
     *  The initial request tries to fetch as many entries as configured with the `threshold` parameter, without
     * specifying any filters/sorters. In addition, the query parameter `$inlinecount` is added. The binding
     * assumes, that the threshold given by the application can be met, but it adapts its behavior depending
     * on the response:  If the response returns fewer (or just as many) entries as the threshold,
     * the binding will behave exactly like when using the operation mode `Client`. Initially configured filters/sorters
     * will be applied afterwards on the client.
     * 	 - If the `$inlinecount` is higher than the threshold, the binding will behave like in operation mode
     * 			`Server`. In this case a new data request containing the initially set filters/sorters will be issued.
     * 			 It is up to the application to chose an appropriate threshold value. Ideally, it should be high
     * 			enough to fetch all data in the most common scenarios (to avoid a fallback to operation mode `Server`,
     * 			requiring an additional request), but it also should be low enough to ensure a fast response in case

     *
     * Services which include the `hierarchy-node-descendant-count-for` annotation and expose the data points
     * sorted in a depth-first, pre-order manner, can use an optimized auto-expand feature by specifying the
     * `numberOfExpandedLevels` in the binding parameters. This will pre-expand the hierarchy to the given number

     * application filters}. Be aware that this applies only to filters which do not prevent the creation of
     * a hierarchy. So filtering on a property (e.g. a "Customer") is fine, as long as the application ensures
     * that the responses from the back end are sufficient to create a valid hierarchy on the client. Subsequent
     * paging requests for sibling and child nodes must also return responses, since the filters are sent with
     * every request. Using control-defined filters (see {@link sap.ui.model.FilterType.Control}) via the {@link
     * #filter} function is not supported for the operation mode `Server`.
     *
     * OperationMode.Client and OperationMode.Auto: The ODataTreeBinding supports control-defined filters only
     * in operation modes `Client` and `Auto`. With these operation modes, the filters and sorters are applied
     * on the client, like for the {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataListBinding}.
     *
     * The operation modes `Client` and `Auto` are only supported for services which expose the hierarchy annotations
     * mentioned above, but do **not** expose the `hierarchy-node-descendant-count-for` annotation. Services
     * with hierarchy annotations including the `hierarchy-node-descendant-count-for` annotation, do **not**
     * support the operation modes `Client` and `Auto`. **Note:** {@link sap.ui.model.odata.OperationMode.Auto}

     * for comprehensive information on the topic.
     *
     * For each created entry a request is created and stored in a request queue. The request queue can be submitted
     * by calling {@link #submitChanges}. As long as the context is transient (see {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v2.Context#isTransient}),
     * {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v2.ODataModel#resetChanges} with the `bDeleteCreatedEntities` parameter set
     * to `true` can be used to delete the created entity again.
     *
     * If the creation of the entity on the server failed, it is repeated automatically.
     *
     * The optional parameter `mParameters.properties` can be used as follows:
     * 	 - `properties` could be an array containing the property names which should be included in the new
     * 			entry. Other properties defined in the entity type won't be included.
     * 	 - `properties` could be an object which includes the desired properties and the corresponding values
     * 			which should be used for the created entry.   If `properties` is not specified, all properties in
     * 			the entity type will be included in the created entry.
     *
     * If there are no values specified, the properties will have `undefined` values.
     *
     * The `properties` can be modified via property bindings relative to the returned context instance.
     *
     * The parameter `expand` is supported since 1.78.0. If this parameter is set, the given navigation properties
     * are expanded automatically with the same $batch request in which the POST request for the creation is
     * contained. Ensure that the batch mode is used and the back-end service supports GET requests relative
     * to a content ID outside the changeset. The success and error callback functions are called only once,
     * even if there are two requests in the `$batch` related to a single call of {@link #createEntry}:
     *
     * 	 - a POST request for creating an entity,
     * 	 - a GET request for requesting the navigation properties for the just created entity.   The following
     * 			outcomes are possible:
     * 	 - If both requests succeed, the success handler is called with the merged data of the POST and the
     * 			GET request and with the response of the POST request.
     * 	 - If the POST request fails, the GET request also fails. In that case the error callback handler is
     * 			called with the error response of the POST request.
     * 	 - If the POST request succeeds but the GET request for the navigation properties fails, the success
     * 			handler is called with the data and the response of the POST request. The response object of the success
     * 			handler call and the response parameter of the corresponding `requestFailed` and `requestCompleted` events
     * 			have an additional property `expandAfterCreateFailed` set to `true`.
     *
     * Note: If a server requires a property in the request, you must supply this property in the initial data,
     * for example if the server requires a unit for an amount. This also applies if this property has a default
     * value.
     *
     * Note: A deep create (including data defined by navigation properties) is not supported. The dependent
     * entity has to be created using a second list binding, after this entity has been saved successfully in
     * the back-end system.
     *

     * to the hard-coded model name "@i18n" with arbitrary path are not turned into a fixed text, but kept as
     * a data binding expression; this allows local annotation files to refer to a resource bundle for internationalization.
     *  dynamic "14.5.1 Comparison and Logical Operators": These are turned into expression bindings to
     * perform the operations at runtime.  dynamic "14.5.3 Expression edm:Apply":
     * 	 "14.5.3.1.1 Function odata.concat": This is turned into a data binding expression relative to an entity.

     * Elements can be conditionally added to the collection when using dynamic "14.5.6 Expression edm:If" as
     * a direct child.  dynamic "14.5.6 Expression edm:If": This is turned into an expression binding to

     * These are turned into data bindings relative to an entity, including type information and constraints
     * as available from metadata, for example `"{path : 'Name', type : 'sap.ui.model.odata.type.String', constraints
     * : {'maxLength' : 255}, formatOptions : {'parseKeepsEmptyString' : true}}"`. Depending on the used type,
     * some additional constraints and format options of this type are set:
     * 	 Edm.DateTime: The "displayFormat" constraint is set to the value of the "sap:display-format" annotation
     * of the referenced property.  Edm.Decimal: The "precision" and "scale" constraints are set to the
     * values of the corresponding attributes of the referenced property. The "minimum", "maximum", "minimumExclusive",
     * and "maximumExclusive" constraints are set to the values of the corresponding "Org.OData.Validation.V1"
     * annotation of the referenced property; note that in this case only constant expressions are supported
     * to determine the annotation value.  Edm.String: The "maxLength" constraint is set to the value of
     * the corresponding attribute of the referenced property, and the "isDigitSequence" constraint is set to
     * the value of the "com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.IsDigitSequence" annotation of the referenced property;
     * note that in this case only constant expressions are supported to determine the annotation value. The
     * "parseKeepsEmptyString" format option is set.  Since 1.78.0, both "edm:Path" and "edm:PropertyPath"
     * are also supported if `vRawValue` is the path itself, and not the object wrapping it.
     *
     * $AnnotationPath and $Path: If `oDetails.context.getPath()` contains a single "$AnnotationPath" or "$Path"
     * segment, the value corresponding to that segment is considered as a data binding path prefix whenever
     * a dynamic "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path" or "14.5.13 Expression edm:PropertyPath" is turned into a data
     * binding. Use {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.resolve$Path} to avoid these prefixes in cases
     * where they are not applicable.
     *
     * $AnnotationPath: Example for "$AnnotationPath" in the context's path:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Annotations Target="com.sap.gateway.default.iwbep.tea_busi.v0001.EQUIPMENT">

     *     <Collection>
     *       <Record Type="com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.ReferenceFacet">
     *         <PropertyValue Property="Target" AnnotationPath="EQUIPMENT_2_PRODUCT/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.QuickInfo" />
     *       </Record>
     *     </Collection>
     *   </Annotation>
     * </Annotations>
     * <Annotations Target="com.sap.gateway.default.iwbep.tea_busi_product.v0001.Product">
     *   <Annotation Term="com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.QuickInfo" Path="Name" />
     * </Annotations>
     * ```
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Text text="{meta>/Equipments/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.Facets/0/Target/$AnnotationPath/@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format}" />
     * ```
     *  `format` returns a binding with path "EQUIPMENT_2_PRODUCT/Name".
     *
     * $Path: Example for "$Path" in the context's path:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Annotations Target="com.sap.gateway.default.iwbep.tea_busi.v0001.EQUIPMENT">

     * </Annotations>
     * ```
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Text text="{meta>/Equipments/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.QuickInfo@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format}" />
     * ```
     *  `format` returns a binding with path "EQUIPMENT_2_PRODUCT/PRODUCT_2_SUPPLIER/Supplier_Name".
     *
     * Annotations on an Operation or a Parameter: Since 1.71.0, for annotations on an operation or a parameter,
     * the binding parameter's name is stripped off any dynamic "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path" and "14.5.13 Expression
     * edm:PropertyPath" where it might be used as a first segment. Since 1.76.0 this does not apply to annotations
     * on a parameter. In the former case, we assume that the resulting data binding is relative to the parent
     * context of the operation binding, that is, to the context representing the binding parameter itself.
     * In the latter case, we assume that the resulting data binding is relative to the parameter context of
     * the operation binding (see {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#getParameterContext}).
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *    <Action Name="ShipProduct" EntitySetPath="_it" IsBound="true" >
     *        <Parameter Name="_it" Type="name.space.Product" Nullable="false"/>
     *        <Parameter Name="City" Type="Edm.String"/>
     *    </Action>
     * ```
     *  For the operation `ShipProduct` mentioned above, the following annotation targets an operation parameter
     * and refers back to the binding parameter.
     * ```javascript
     *
     *     <Annotations Target="name.space.ShipProduct(name.space.Product)/City">
     *        <Annotation Term="com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text" Path="_it/SupplierIdentifier"/>
     *     </Annotations>
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Using `AnnotationHelper.format` like
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Text text="{meta>/Products/name.space.ShipProduct/$Parameter/City@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format}" />
     * ```
     *  results in
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Text text="{path:'_it/SupplierIdentifier',type:'sap.ui.model.odata.type.Int32'}" />
     * ```
     *  and the data binding evaluates to the `SupplierIdentifier` property of the entity the operation is called
     * on.
     *
     * Operation Parameters: Since 1.73.0, this function can be used on action or function parameters and results
     * in a relative data binding, just like a "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path".
     *
     * Assume we have the following metadata for an unbound action "AcChangeTeamBudgetByID":
     * ```javascript
     *
     *    <Action Name="AcChangeTeamBudgetByID">
     *        <Parameter Name="TeamID" Type="Edm.String" Nullable="false" MaxLength="10"/>
     *        <Parameter Name="Budget" Type="Edm.Decimal" Nullable="false" Precision="16" Scale="variable"/>
     *    </Action>
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Let `ChangeTeamBudgetByID` be the action import of this action. Using `AnnotationHelper.format` for the
     * `TeamID` like
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Text text="{meta>/ChangeTeamBudgetByID/TeamID@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format}" />
     * ```
     *  results in
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Text text="{path:'TeamID',type:'sap.ui.model.odata.type.String',constraints:{'maxLength':10,'nullable':false},formatOptions:{'parseKeepsEmptyString':true}}" />
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Binding Parameters and Format Options: Since 1.77.0, binding parameters and format options can be given.
     * The usage
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Input value="{meta>/ChangeTeamBudgetByID/Budget@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format($($$noPatch : true$), $(groupingEnabled : false$))}" />
     * ```
     *  results in a data binding with the given binding parameters and format options. Note how, for an object
     * notation, curly brackets must be replaced by `$(` and `$)` respectively. Use `null`, not `undefined`,
     * in case no binding parameters are needed.
     *
     * Structural Properties: Since 1.78.0, this function can be used on a structural property and results in
     * a relative data binding, just like a "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path". The usage
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Input value="{meta>/Department/Name@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.format}"/>
     * ```
     *  results in
     * ```javascript
     *
     * < Input value="{path:'Name',type:'sap.ui.model.odata.type.String',constraints:{'maxLength':40,'nullable':false},formatOptions:{'parseKeepsEmptyString':true}}"/>
     * ```

     * Function odata.fillUriTemplate": This is turned into an expression binding to fill the template at runtime.
     *  "14.5.3.1.3 Function odata.uriEncode": This is turned into an expression binding to encode the parameter
     * at runtime.  Apply functions may be nested arbitrarily.   dynamic "14.5.5 Expression edm:Collection":
     * This is turned into an expression binding to be evaluated at runtime. Elements can be conditionally added
     * to the collection when using dynamic "14.5.6 Expression edm:If" as a direct child.  dynamic "14.5.6
     * Expression edm:If": This is turned into an expression binding to be evaluated at runtime. The expression
     * is a conditional expression like `"{=condition ? expression1 : expression2}"`.  dynamic "14.5.10
     * Expression edm:Null": This is turned into a `null` value. It is ignored in `odata.concat`.  dynamic
     * "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path" and "14.5.13 Expression edm:PropertyPath": These are turned into simple
     * data bindings, for example `"{Name}"`. Since 1.78.0, both are also supported if `vRawValue` is the path
     * itself, and not the object wrapping it.
     *
     * Annotations on an Operation or a Parameter: Since 1.71.0, for annotations on an operation or a parameter,
     * the binding parameter's name is stripped off any dynamic "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path" and "14.5.13 Expression
     * edm:PropertyPath" where it might be used as a first segment. Since 1.76.0 this does not apply to annotations
     * on a parameter. In the former case, we assume that the resulting data binding is relative to the parent
     * context of the operation binding, that is, to the context representing the binding parameter itself.
     * In the latter case, we assume that the resulting data binding is relative to the parameter context of
     * the operation binding (see {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#getParameterContext}).
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *    <Action Name="ShipProduct" EntitySetPath="_it" IsBound="true" >
     *        <Parameter Name="_it" Type="name.space.Product" Nullable="false"/>
     *        <Parameter Name="City" Type="Edm.String"/>
     *    </Action>
     * ```
     *  For the operation `ShipProduct` mentioned above, the following annotation targets an operation parameter
     * and refers back to the binding parameter.
     * ```javascript
     *
     *     <Annotations Target="name.space.ShipProduct(name.space.Product)/City">
     *        <Annotation Term="com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text" Path="_it/SupplierIdentifier"/>
     *     </Annotations>
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Using `AnnotationHelper.value` like
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Text text="{meta>/Products/name.space.ShipProduct/$Parameter/City@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.value}" />
     * ```
     *  results in
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Text text="{_it/SupplierIdentifier}" />
     * ```
     *  and the data binding evaluates to the `SupplierIdentifier` property of the entity the operation is called
     * on.
     *
     * Operation Parameters: Since 1.73.0, this function can be used on action or function parameters and results
     * in a relative data binding, just like a "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path".
     *
     * Assume we have the following metadata for an unbound action "AcChangeTeamBudgetByID":
     * ```javascript
     *
     *    <Action Name="AcChangeTeamBudgetByID">
     *        <Parameter Name="TeamID" Type="Edm.String" Nullable="false" MaxLength="10"/>
     *        <Parameter Name="Budget" Type="Edm.Decimal" Nullable="false" Precision="16" Scale="variable"/>
     *    </Action>
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Let `ChangeTeamBudgetByID` be the action import of this action. Using `AnnotationHelper.value` for the
     * `TeamID` like
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Text text="{meta>/ChangeTeamBudgetByID/TeamID@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.value}" />
     * ```
     *  results in
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Text text="{TeamID}" />
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Binding Parameters: Since 1.77.0, binding parameters can be given. The usage
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Input value="{meta>/ChangeTeamBudgetByID/Budget@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.value($($$noPatch : true$))}" />
     * ```
     *  results in a data binding with the given binding parameters. Note how, for an object notation, curly
     * brackets must be replaced by `$(` and `$)` respectively.
     *
     * Structural Properties: Since 1.78.0, this function can be used on a structural property and results in
     * a relative data binding, just like a "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path". The usage
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <Input value="{meta>/Department/Name@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.value}"/>
     * ```
     *  results in
     * ```javascript

   * following events: 'AggregatedDataStateChange', 'change', 'dataReceived', 'dataRequested', 'DataStateChange',
   * 'patchCompleted', and 'patchSent'. For other events, an error is thrown.
   *
   * A context binding can also be used as an operation binding to support bound actions, action imports,
   * bound functions and function imports. If you want to control the execution time of an operation, for
   * example a function import named "GetNumberOfAvailableItems", create a context binding for the path "/GetNumberOfAvailableItems(...)"
   * (as specified here, including the three dots). Such an operation binding is deferred, meaning
   * that it does not request automatically, but only when you call {@link #execute}. {@link #refresh} is
   * always ignored for actions and action imports. For bound functions and function imports, it is ignored
   * if {@link #execute} has not yet been called. Afterwards it results in another call of the function with
   * the parameter values of the last execute.
   *
   * The binding parameter for bound actions or bound functions may be given in the binding path, for example
   * "/SalesOrderList('42')/name.space.SalesOrder_Confirm". This can be used if the exact entity for the binding
   * parameter is known in advance. If you use a relative binding instead, the operation path is a concatenation
   * of the parent context's canonical path and the deferred binding's path.
   *
   * **Example**: You have a table with a list binding to "/SalesOrderList". In each row you have a button
   * to confirm the sales order, with the relative binding "name.space.SalesOrder_Confirm(...)". Then the
   * parent context for such a button refers to an entity in "SalesOrderList", so its canonical path is "/SalesOrderList('SalesOrderID')"
   * and the resulting path for the action is "/SalesOrderList('SalesOrderID')/name.space.SalesOrder_Confirm".
   *
   * This also works if the relative path of the deferred operation binding starts with a navigation property.
   * Then this navigation property will be part of the operation's resource path, which is still valid.
   *
   * A deferred operation binding is not allowed to have another deferred operation binding as parent.

     * for example if the server requires a unit for an amount. This also applies if this property has a default
     * value.
     *
     * Note: After creation, the created entity is refreshed to ensure that the data specified in this list
     * binding's $expand is available. This refresh is done via the group ID of the binding, unless the group

     *
     * A relative path is appended to the context's path separated by a forward slash("/"). A relative path
     * starting with "@" (that is, an annotation) is appended without a separator. Use "./" as a prefix for
     * such a relative path to enforce a separator.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     * <template:with path="/EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE" var="property">
     *   <!-- /EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE/$Type -->
     *   "{property>$Type}"
     *
     *   <!-- /EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text -->
     *   "{property>@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text}"
     *
     *   <!-- /EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text -->
     *   "{property>./@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text}"
     * </template:with>
     * ```
     *
     *
     * The basic idea is that every path described in "14.2.1 Attribute Target" in specification "OData Version 4.0 Part 3: Common Schema Definition Language"
     * is a valid absolute path within the metadata model if a leading slash is added; for example "/" + "MySchema.MyEntityContainer/MyEntitySet/MyComplexProperty/MyNavigationProperty".
     * Also, every path described in "14.5.2 Expression edm:AnnotationPath", "14.5.11 Expression edm:NavigationPropertyPath",
     * "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path", and "14.5.13 Expression edm:PropertyPath" is a valid relative path within
     * the metadata model if a suitable prefix is added which addresses an entity container, entity set, singleton,
     * complex type, entity type, or property; for example "/MySchema.MyEntityType/MyProperty" + "@vCard.Address#work/FullName".
     *
     * The absolute path is split into segments and followed step-by-step, starting at the global scope of all
     * known qualified OData names. There are two technical properties there: "$Version" (typically "4.0") and
     * "$EntityContainer" with the name of the single entity container for this metadata model's service.
     *
     * An empty segment in between is invalid, except to force return type lookup for operation overloads (see
     * below). An empty segment at the end caused by a trailing slash differentiates between a name and the
     * object it refers to. This way, "/$EntityContainer" refers to the name of the single entity container
     * and "/$EntityContainer/" refers to the single entity container as an object.
     *
     * The segment "@sapui.name" refers back to the last OData name (simple identifier or qualified name) or
     * annotation name encountered during path traversal immediately before "@sapui.name":
     * 	 "/EMPLOYEES@sapui.name" results in "EMPLOYEES" and "/EMPLOYEES/@sapui.name" results in the same as
     * "/EMPLOYEES/$Type", that is, the qualified name of the entity set's type (see below how "$Type" is inserted
     * implicitly). Note how the separating slash again makes a difference here.  "/EMPLOYEES/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label@sapui.name"
     * results in "@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label" and a slash does not make any difference as long as
     * the annotation does not have a "$Type" property.  A technical property (that is, a numerical segment
     * or one starting with a "$") immediately before "@sapui.name" is invalid, for example "/$EntityContainer@sapui.name".
     *  The path must not continue after "@sapui.name".
     *
     * If the current object is a string value, that string value is treated as a relative path and followed
     * step-by-step before the next segment is processed. Except for this, a path must not continue if it comes
     * across a non-object value. Such a string value can be a qualified name (example path "/$EntityContainer/..."),
     * a simple identifier (example path "/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/TEAM_2_EMPLOYEES/...") including
     * the special name "$ReturnType" (since 1.71.0), or even a path according to "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path"
     * etc. (example path "/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path/...".
     *
     * Segments starting with an "@" character, for example "@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Label", address
     * annotations at the current object. As the first segment, they refer to the single entity container. For
     * objects which can only be annotated inline (see "14.3 Element edm:Annotation" minus "14.2.1 Attribute
     * Target"), the object already contains the annotations as a property. For objects which can (only or also)
     * be annotated via external targeting, the object does not contain any annotation as a property. Such annotations
     * MUST be accessed via a path. Such objects include operations (that is, actions and functions) and their
     * parameters, which can be annotated for a single overload or for all overloads at the same time.
     *
     * Segments starting with an OData name followed by an "@" character, for example "/TEAMS@Org.OData.Capabilities.V1.TopSupported",
     * address annotations at an entity set, singleton, or property, not at the corresponding type. In contrast,
     * "/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Deletable" (note the separating slash) addresses an annotation
     * at the entity set's type. This is in line with the special rule of "14.5.12 Expression edm:Path" regarding
     * annotations at a navigation property itself.
     *
     * "@" can be used as a segment to address a map of all annotations of the current object. This is useful
     * for iteration, for example via `<template:repeat list="{entityType>@}" ...>`.
     *
     * Annotations of an annotation are addressed not by two separate segments, but by a single segment like
     * "@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.Text@com.sap.vocabularies.Common.v1.TextArrangement". Each annotation
     * can have a qualifier, for example "@first#foo@second#bar". Note: If the first annotation's value is a
     * record, a separate segment addresses an annotation of that record, not an annotation of the first annotation
     * itself. In a similar way, annotations of "7.2 Element edm:ReferentialConstraint", "7.3 Element edm:OnDelete",
     * "10.2 Element edm:Member" and "14.5.14.2 Element edm:PropertyValue" are addressed by segments like "<7.2.1
     * Attribute Property>@...", "$OnDelete@...", "<10.2.1 Attribute Name>@..." and "<14.5.14.2.1 Attribute
     * Property>@..." (where angle brackets denote a variable part and sections refer to specification "OData Version 4.0 Part 3:
     * Common Schema Definition Language").
     *
     * Annotations starting with "@@", for example "@@sap.ui.model.odata.v4.AnnotationHelper.isMultiple" or
     * "@@.AH.isMultiple" or "@@.isMultiple", represent computed annotations. Their name without the "@@" prefix
     * must refer to a function in `mParameters.scope` in case of a relative name starting with a dot, which
     * is stripped before lookup; see the `<template:alias>` instruction for XML Templating. In case of an
     * absolute name, it is searched in `mParameters.scope` first and then in the global namespace. The names
     * "requestCurrencyCodes" and "requestUnitsOfMeasure" default to {@link #requestCurrencyCodes} and {@link
     * #requestUnitsOfMeasure} resp. if not present in `mParameters.scope`. This function is called with the
     * current object (or primitive value) and additional details and returns the result of this {@link #requestObject}
     * call. The additional details are given as an object with the following properties:
     * 	 `{boolean} $$valueAsPromise` Whether the computed annotation may return a `Promise` resolving with
     * its value (since 1.57.0)  `{@link sap.ui.model.Context} context` Points to the current object
     * `{object} overload` In case of annotations of an operation or a parameter, if filtering by binding parameter
     * determines a single operation overload, that overload is passed (since 1.71.0), else `undefined`
     * `{string} schemaChildName` The qualified name of the schema child where the computed annotation has been
     * found  Computed annotations cannot be iterated by "@". The path must not continue after a computed
     * annotation. Since 1.77.0, arguments can be given to a computed annotation much like a JavaScript function
     * call. The left parenthesis must immediately follow the name and no whitespace must follow the right parenthesis.
     * In between, a comma separated list of JSON values may be given (see `JSON.parse`); string literals may
     * be enclosed in single or double quotes; property names in object literals need not be quoted; curly brackets
     * must be replaced by `$(` and `$)` respectively, no matter where they appear, and there is no escaping
     * for `$(` and `$)` to prevent replacement back to curly brackets before parsing; as usual, `null` is supported
     * while `undefined` is not. Example: "@@AH.format($(style : 'short'$)))" or "@@AH.format(null, $($$noPatch
     * : true$)))".
     *
     * A segment which represents an OData qualified name is looked up in the global scope ("scope lookup")
     * and thus determines a schema child which is used later on. Unknown qualified names are invalid. This
     * way, "/acme.DefaultContainer/EMPLOYEES" addresses the "EMPLOYEES" child of the schema child named "acme.DefaultContainer".
     * This also works indirectly ("/$EntityContainer/EMPLOYEES") and implicitly ("/EMPLOYEES", see below).
     *
     * A segment which represents an OData simple identifier (or the special names "$ReturnType", since 1.71.0,
     * or "$Parameter", since 1.73.0) needs special preparations. The same applies to the empty segment after
     * a trailing slash.   If the current object has a "$Action", "$Function" or "$Type" property, it
     * is used for scope lookup first. This way, "/EMPLOYEES/ENTRYDATE" addresses the same object as "/EMPLOYEES/$Type/ENTRYDATE",
     * namely the "ENTRYDATE" child of the entity type corresponding to the "EMPLOYEES" child of the entity
     * container. The other cases jump from an operation import to the corresponding operation overloads.
     * Else if the segment is the first one within its path, the last schema child addressed via scope lookup
     * is used instead of the current object. This can only happen indirectly as in "/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/TEAM_2_EMPLOYEES/..."
     * where the schema child is the entity container and the navigation property binding can contain the simple
     * identifier of another entity set within the same container.
     *
     * If the segment is the first one overall, "$EntityContainer" is inserted into the path implicitly. In
     * other words, the entity container is used as the initial schema child. This way, "/EMPLOYEES" addresses
     * the same object as "/$EntityContainer/EMPLOYEES", namely the "EMPLOYEES" child of the entity container.
     *  Afterwards, if the current object is an array, it represents overloads for an operation. Annotations
     * of an operation (since 1.71.0) or a parameter (since 1.66.0) can be immediately addressed, no matter
     * if they apply for a single overload or for all overloads at the same time, for example "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction@"
     * or "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/Team_ID@". Annotations of an unbound operation overload can be addressed like
     * "/OperationImport/@$ui5.overload@", while "/OperationImport/@" addresses annotations of the operation
     * import itself. The special name "$ReturnType" can be used (since 1.71.0) like a parameter to address
     * annotations of the return type instead, for example "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$ReturnType@".
     *
     * Operation overloads are then filtered by binding parameter; multiple overloads after filtering are invalid
     * except if addressing all overloads via the segment "@$ui5.overload", for example "/acme.NewAction/@$ui5.overload".
     *
     * Once a single overload has been determined, its parameters can be immediately addressed, for example
     * "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/Team_ID", or the special name "$Parameter" can be used (since 1.73.0), for example
     * "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$Parameter/Team_ID". The special name "$ReturnType" can be used (since 1.71.0)
     * like a parameter to address the return type instead, for example "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$ReturnType".
     * For all other names, the overload's "$ReturnType/$Type" is used for scope lookup. This way, "/GetOldestWorker/AGE"
     * addresses the same object as "/GetOldestWorker/$ReturnType/AGE" or "/GetOldestWorker/$Function/0/$ReturnType/$Type/AGE",
     * and "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/MemberCount" (assuming "MemberCount" is not a parameter in this example) addresses
     * the same object as "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/$ReturnType/MemberCount" or "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction/@$ui5.overload/0/$ReturnType/$Type/MemberCount".
     * In case a name can refer both to a parameter and to a property of the return type, an empty segment can
     * be used instead of "@$ui5.overload/0/$ReturnType/$Type" or "$ReturnType" to force return type lookup,
     * for example "/TEAMS/acme.NewAction//Team_ID".
     *
     * For primitive return types, the special segment "value" can be used to refer to the return type itself
     * (see {@link sap.ui.model.odata.v4.ODataContextBinding#execute}). This way, "/GetOldestAge/value" addresses
     * the same object as "/GetOldestAge/$ReturnType" or "/GetOldestAge/$Function/0/$ReturnType" or "/GetOldestAge/@$ui5.overload/0/$ReturnType"
     * (which is needed for automatic type determination, see {@link #requestUI5Type}).
     *
     * A trailing slash can be used to continue a path and thus force scope lookup or OData simple identifier
     * preparations, but then stay at the current object. This way, "/EMPLOYEES/$Type/" addresses the entity
     * type itself corresponding to the "EMPLOYEES" child of the entity container. Although the empty segment
     * is not an OData simple identifier, it can be used as a placeholder for one. In this way, "/EMPLOYEES/"
     * addresses the same entity type as "/EMPLOYEES/$Type/". That entity type in turn is a map of all its OData
     * children (that is, structural and navigation properties) and determines the set of possible child names
     * that might be used after the trailing slash.
     *
     * "$" can be used as the last segment to continue a path and thus force scope lookup, but no OData simple
     * identifier preparations. In this way, it serves as a placeholder for a technical property. The path must
     * not continue after "$", except for a computed annotation. Example: "/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path/$"
     * addresses the referenced property itself, not the corresponding type like "/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Value/$Path/"
     * does. "/TEAMS/@com.sap.vocabularies.UI.v1.LineItem/0/Target/$NavigationPropertyPath/$@@.isMultiple" calls
     * a computed annotation on the navigation property itself, not on the corresponding type.
     *
     * Any other segment, including an OData simple identifier, is looked up as a property of the current object.
     * Segments which themselves represent a path, such as the keys for the "$ReferentialConstraint" and "$NavigationPropertyBinding"
     * maps, need to use URL encoding for the slash character ("%2F"), for example "/TEAMS/$NavigationPropertyBinding/Address%2FCountries/...".

         * of built-in matchers, see {@link sap.ui.test.matchers}.
         *
         * Matchers are applied to each control found by the `waitFor` function. The matchers are a pipeline: the
         * first matcher gets a control as an input parameter, each subsequent matcher gets the same input as the
         * previous one, if the previous output is `true`.
         *
         * If the previous output is a truthy value, the next matcher will receive this value as an input parameter.
         * If there is a matcher that does not match a control (for example, returns a falsy value), then the control
         * is filtered out.
         *
         * Check function is only called if the matchers matched at least one control, for example, it is not called
         * if matchers filter out all controls/values. Check and success are be called with all matching controls
         * as an input parameter. A matcher inline function has one parameter - an array of controls, and returns
         * an array of the filtered controls.
         *
         * A matcher instance could extend `sap.ui.test.matchers.Matcher` and must have a method with name `isMatching`,
         * that accepts an array of controls and returns an array of the filtered controls.
         *
         * A declarative matcher object is a set of key-value pairs created by the object literal notation, such
         * that:
         * 	Every key is a name of an OPA5 built-in matcher, starting with a lower case letter. The following example
         * declares an `sap.ui.test.matchers.Properties` matcher:
         * ```javascript
         *             matchers: {
         *                 properties: {<...>}
         *             }
         * ```
         *   Every value is an object or an array or objects. Each object represents the properties that
         * will be fed to one instance of the declared matcher. The following example declares one `sap.ui.test.matchers.Properties`
         * matcher for property "text" and value "hello":
         * ```javascript
         *             matchers: {
         *                 properties: {text: "hello"}
         *             }
         * ```
         *
         *
         * The following example declares two `sap.ui.test.matchers.Properties` matchers (the `text` property with
         * value `hello` and the `number` property with value `0`):
         * ```javascript
         *             matchers: {
         *                 properties: [
         *                     {text: "hello"},

         * @since 1.42 Only has an effect if set to true. Since 1.53 it can also be a plain object. When autoWait
         * is true, the waitFor statement will not execute success callbacks as long as there is pending asynchronous
         * work such as for example: open XMLHTTPRequests (requests to a server), scheduled delayed work and promises,
         * unfinished UI navigation. In addition, the control state will be checked with the {@link sap.ui.test.matchers.Interactable}
         * matcher, and the control will have to be enabled. So when autoWait is enabled, success behaves like an
         * action in terms of waiting. It is recommended to set this value to true for all your waitFor statements
         * using:
         * ```javascript
         *
         *     Opa5.extendConfig({
         *         autoWait: true
         *     });
         * ```
         *  Why it is recommended: When writing a huge set of tests and executing them frequently you might face
         * tests that are sometimes successful but sometimes they are not. Setting the autoWait to true should stabilize
         * most of those tests. The default "false" could not be changed since it causes existing tests to fail.
         * There are cases where you do not want to wait for controls to be "Interactable": For example when you
         * are testing the Busy indication of your UI during the sending of a request. But these cases are the exception
         * so it is better to explicitly adding autoWait: false to this waitFor.
         * ```javascript
         *
         *     this.waitFor({
         *         id: "myButton",
         *         autoWait: false,
         *         success: function (oButton) {
         *              Opa5.assert.ok(oButton.getBusy(), "My Button was busy");
         *         }
         *     });
         * ```
         *  This is also the easiest way of migrating existing tests. First extend the config, then see which waitFors
         * will time out and finally disable autoWait in these Tests.

     * @SINCE 1.27.0
     *
     * Defines a JavaScript module with its ID, its dependencies and a module export value or factory.
     *
     * The typical and only suggested usage of this method is to have one single, top level call to `sap.ui.define`
     * in one JavaScript resource (file). When a module is requested by its module ID for the first time, the
     * corresponding resource is determined from the ID and the current {@link sap.ui.loader.config configuration}.
     * The resource will be loaded and executed which in turn will execute the top level `sap.ui.define` call.
     *
     * If the module ID was omitted from that call, it will be substituted by the ID that was used to request
     * the module. As a preparation step, the dependencies as well as their transitive dependencies, will be
     * loaded. Then, the module value (its export) will be determined: if a static value (object, literal) was
     * given as `vFactory`, that value will be the module value. If a function was given, that function will
     * be called (providing the module exports of the declared dependencies as parameters to the function) and
     * its return value will be used as module export value. The framework internally associates the resulting
     * value with the module ID and provides it to the original requester of the module. Whenever the module
     * is requested again, the same export value will be returned (modules are executed only once).
     *
     * Example:
     *  The following example defines a module, but doesn't hard code the module ID. If stored in a file 'sap/mylib/SomeClass.js',
     * it can be requested with the ID 'sap/mylib/SomeClass'.
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   sap.ui.define(['./Helper', 'sap/m/Bar'], function(Helper,Bar) {
     *
     *     // create a new class
     *     var SomeClass = function() {};
     *
     *     // add methods to its prototype
     *     SomeClass.prototype.foo = function() {
     *
     *         // use a function from the dependency 'Helper' in the same package (e.g. 'sap/mylib/Helper' )
     *         var mSettings = Helper.foo();
     *
     *         // create and return an sap.m.Bar (using its local name 'Bar')
     *         return new Bar(mSettings);
     *
     *     }
     *
     *     // return the class as module value
     *     return SomeClass;
     *
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * In another module or in an application HTML page, the {@link sap.ui.require} API can be used to load
     * the sap/mylib/Something module and to work with it:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     * sap.ui.require(['sap/mylib/Something'], function(Something) {
     *
     *   // instantiate a Something and call foo() on it
     *   new Something().foo();
     *
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Module Name Syntax:
     *
     * `sap.ui.define` uses a simplified variant of the {@link jQuery.sap.getResourcePath unified resource name}
     * syntax for the module's own name as well as for its dependencies. The only difference to that syntax
     * is, that for `sap.ui.define` and `sap.ui.require`, the extension (which always would be '.js') has to
     * be omitted. Both methods always add this extension internally.
     *
     * As a convenience, the name of a dependency can start with the segment './' which will be replaced by
     * the name of the package that contains the currently defined module (relative name).
     *
     * It is best practice to omit the name of the defined module (first parameter) and to use relative names
     * for the dependencies whenever possible. This reduces the necessary configuration, simplifies renaming
     * of packages and allows to map them to a different namespace.
     *
     * Dependency to Modules:
     *
     * If a dependencies array is given, each entry represents the name of another module that the currently
     * defined module depends on. All dependency modules are loaded before the export of the currently defined
     * module is determined. The module export of each dependency module will be provided as a parameter to
     * a factory function, the order of the parameters will match the order of the modules in the dependencies
     * array.
     *
     * **Note:** The order in which the dependency modules are executed is **not** defined by the order
     * in the dependencies array! The execution order is affected by dependencies between the dependency
     * modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither
     * module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution
     * order (other than expressed by their dependencies).
     *
     * **Note:** A static module export (a literal provided to `sap.ui.define`) cannot depend on the module
     * exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved. As
     * an alternative, modules can define a factory function, calculate a static export value in that function,
     * potentially based on the dependencies, and return the result as module export value. The same approach
     * must be taken when the module export is supposed to be a function.
     *
     * Asynchronous Contract:
     *
     * `sap.ui.define` is designed to support real Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) in future, although
     * it internally still might use synchronous module loading, depending on configuration and context. However,
     * callers of `sap.ui.define` must never rely on any synchronous behavior that they might observe in a specific
     * test scenario.
     *
     * For example, callers of `sap.ui.define` must not use the module export value immediately after invoking
     * `sap.ui.define`:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // COUNTER EXAMPLE HOW __NOT__ TO DO IT
     *
     *   // define a class Something as AMD module
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', [], function() {
     *     var Something = function() {};
     *     return Something;
     *   });
     *
     *   // DON'T DO THAT!
     *   // accessing the class _synchronously_ after sap.ui.define was called
     *   new Something();
     *
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Applications that need to ensure synchronous module definition or synchronous loading of dependencies
     * **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs {@link jQuery.sap.declare} and {@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     *
     * (No) Global References:
     *
     * To be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with `sap.ui.define` should not make any use of
     * global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies
     * to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.
     *
     * As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will
     * be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel
     * to the old global names. The fourth parameter of `sap.ui.define` has been added to support that transition
     * phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features
     *
     *
     * 	 - Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current
     * 			module is ensured
     * 	 - The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under
     * 			the global name which is derived from the ID of the module
     *
     * The parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future
     * versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.
     *
     * Third Party Modules: Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies
     * in a `sap.ui.define` call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports
     * available, so called ***shims*** have to be defined.
     *
     * Note that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known
     * to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now
     * it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.
     *
     * For third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace `sap/ui/thirdparty/`), the necessary
     * shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module `ui5loader-autoconfig.js` during bootstrap.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'
     *   // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'
     *   // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value
     *   // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js
     *   sap.ui.loader.config({
     *     shim: {
     *       'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {
     *          amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders
     *          exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value
     *       }
     *     }
     *   });
     *
     *   // now the module can be retrieved like other modules
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {
     *
     *     new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)
     *
     *     ...
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Differences to Standard AMD:
     *
     * The current implementation of `sap.ui.define` differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)
     * or from concrete AMD loaders like `requireJS` in several aspects:
     * 	 - The name `sap.ui.define` is different from the plain `define`. This has two reasons: first, it avoids
     * 			the impression that `sap.ui.define` is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows
     * 			the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and `sap.ui.define` in one application as long as UI5
     * 			or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference
     * 			of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect
     * 			methods `define` and `require` to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax,
     * 			can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global
     * 			namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them
     * 			using the `amd:true` flag (see example above)
     * 	 - Depending on configuration and the current context, `sap.ui.define` loads the dependencies of a module
     * 			either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading
     * 			is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce
     * 			synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications
     * 			that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs like
     * 			{@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not
     * 			planned to support this in future
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module
     * 			names that start with a slash. To refer to a module at an absolute URL, a resource root can be registered
     * 			that points to that URL (or to a prefix of it).
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does **not** support the 'sugar' of requireJS where CommonJS style dependency declarations
     * 			using `sap.ui.require("something")` are automagically converted into `sap.ui.define` dependencies before
     * 			executing the factory function.
     *
     * Restrictions, Design Considerations:
     * 	 - **Restriction**: as dependency management is not supported for Non-UI5 modules, the only way to ensure
     * 			proper execution order for such modules currently is to rely on the order in the dependency array. Obviously,
     * 			this only works as long as `sap.ui.define` uses synchronous loading. It will be enhanced when asynchronous
     * 			loading is implemented.
     * 	 - It was discussed to enforce asynchronous execution of the module factory function (e.g. with a timeout
     * 			of 0). But this would have invalidated the current migration scenario where a sync `jQuery.sap.require`
     * 			call can load a `sap.ui.define`'ed module. If the module definition would not execute synchronously,
     * 			the synchronous contract of the require call would be broken (default behavior in existing UI5 applications)
     *
     * 	 - A single file must not contain multiple calls to `sap.ui.define`. Multiple calls currently are only
     * 			supported in the so called 'preload' files that the UI5 merge tooling produces. The exact details of
     * 			how this works might be changed in future implementations and are not part of the API contract
     * See:
     * 	https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api

     * Applications that need to ensure synchronous module definition or synchronous loading of dependencies
     * **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs {@link jQuery.sap.declare} and {@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     *
     * (No) Global References:
     *
     * To be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with `sap.ui.define` should not make any use of
     * global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies
     * to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.
     *
     * As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will
     * be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel
     * to the old global names. The fourth parameter of `sap.ui.define` has been added to support that transition
     * phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features
     *
     *
     * 	 - Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current
     * 			module is ensured
     * 	 - The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under
     * 			the global name which is derived from the ID of the module
     *
     * The parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future
     * versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.
     *
     * Third Party Modules: Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies
     * in a `sap.ui.define` call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports
     * available, so called ***shims*** have to be defined.
     *
     * Note that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known
     * to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now
     * it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.
     *
     * For third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace `sap/ui/thirdparty/`), the necessary
     * shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module `ui5loader-autoconfig.js` during bootstrap.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'
     *   // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'
     *   // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value
     *   // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js
     *   sap.ui.loader.config({
     *     shim: {
     *       'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {
     *          amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders
     *          exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value
     *       }
     *     }
     *   });
     *
     *   // now the module can be retrieved like other modules
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {
     *
     *     new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)
     *
     *     ...
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Differences to Standard AMD:
     *
     * The current implementation of `sap.ui.define` differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)
     * or from concrete AMD loaders like `requireJS` in several aspects:
     * 	 - The name `sap.ui.define` is different from the plain `define`. This has two reasons: first, it avoids
     * 			the impression that `sap.ui.define` is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows
     * 			the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and `sap.ui.define` in one application as long as UI5
     * 			or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference
     * 			of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect
     * 			methods `define` and `require` to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax,
     * 			can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global
     * 			namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them
     * 			using the `amd:true` flag (see example above)
     * 	 - Depending on configuration and the current context, `sap.ui.define` loads the dependencies of a module
     * 			either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading
     * 			is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce
     * 			synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications
     * 			that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs like
     * 			{@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not
     * 			planned to support this in future
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module
     * 			names that start with a slash. To refer to a module at an absolute URL, a resource root can be registered
     * 			that points to that URL (or to a prefix of it).
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does **not** support the 'sugar' of requireJS where CommonJS style dependency declarations
     * 			using `sap.ui.require("something")` are automagically converted into `sap.ui.define` dependencies before
     * 			executing the factory function.
     *
     * Restrictions, Design Considerations:
     * 	 - **Restriction**: as dependency management is not supported for Non-UI5 modules, the only way to ensure
     * 			proper execution order for such modules currently is to rely on the order in the dependency array. Obviously,
     * 			this only works as long as `sap.ui.define` uses synchronous loading. It will be enhanced when asynchronous
     * 			loading is implemented.
     * 	 - It was discussed to enforce asynchronous execution of the module factory function (e.g. with a timeout
     * 			of 0). But this would have invalidated the current migration scenario where a sync `jQuery.sap.require`
     * 			call can load a `sap.ui.define`'ed module. If the module definition would not execute synchronously,
     * 			the synchronous contract of the require call would be broken (default behavior in existing UI5 applications)
     *
     * 	 - A single file must not contain multiple calls to `sap.ui.define`. Multiple calls currently are only
     * 			supported in the so called 'preload' files that the UI5 merge tooling produces. The exact details of
     * 			how this works might be changed in future implementations and are not part of the API contract
     * See:
     * 	https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api

     * @SINCE 1.27.0
     *
     * Defines a JavaScript module with its ID, its dependencies and a module export value or factory.
     *
     * The typical and only suggested usage of this method is to have one single, top level call to `sap.ui.define`
     * in one JavaScript resource (file). When a module is requested by its module ID for the first time, the
     * corresponding resource is determined from the ID and the current {@link sap.ui.loader.config configuration}.
     * The resource will be loaded and executed which in turn will execute the top level `sap.ui.define` call.
     *
     * If the module ID was omitted from that call, it will be substituted by the ID that was used to request
     * the module. As a preparation step, the dependencies as well as their transitive dependencies, will be
     * loaded. Then, the module value (its export) will be determined: if a static value (object, literal) was
     * given as `vFactory`, that value will be the module value. If a function was given, that function will
     * be called (providing the module exports of the declared dependencies as parameters to the function) and
     * its return value will be used as module export value. The framework internally associates the resulting
     * value with the module ID and provides it to the original requester of the module. Whenever the module
     * is requested again, the same export value will be returned (modules are executed only once).
     *
     * Example:
     *  The following example defines a module, but doesn't hard code the module ID. If stored in a file 'sap/mylib/SomeClass.js',
     * it can be requested with the ID 'sap/mylib/SomeClass'.
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   sap.ui.define(['./Helper', 'sap/m/Bar'], function(Helper,Bar) {
     *
     *     // create a new class
     *     var SomeClass = function() {};
     *
     *     // add methods to its prototype
     *     SomeClass.prototype.foo = function() {
     *
     *         // use a function from the dependency 'Helper' in the same package (e.g. 'sap/mylib/Helper' )
     *         var mSettings = Helper.foo();
     *
     *         // create and return an sap.m.Bar (using its local name 'Bar')
     *         return new Bar(mSettings);
     *
     *     }
     *
     *     // return the class as module value
     *     return SomeClass;
     *
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * In another module or in an application HTML page, the {@link sap.ui.require} API can be used to load
     * the sap/mylib/Something module and to work with it:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     * sap.ui.require(['sap/mylib/Something'], function(Something) {
     *
     *   // instantiate a Something and call foo() on it
     *   new Something().foo();
     *
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Module Name Syntax:
     *
     * `sap.ui.define` uses a simplified variant of the {@link jQuery.sap.getResourcePath unified resource name}
     * syntax for the module's own name as well as for its dependencies. The only difference to that syntax
     * is, that for `sap.ui.define` and `sap.ui.require`, the extension (which always would be '.js') has to
     * be omitted. Both methods always add this extension internally.
     *
     * As a convenience, the name of a dependency can start with the segment './' which will be replaced by
     * the name of the package that contains the currently defined module (relative name).
     *
     * It is best practice to omit the name of the defined module (first parameter) and to use relative names
     * for the dependencies whenever possible. This reduces the necessary configuration, simplifies renaming
     * of packages and allows to map them to a different namespace.
     *
     * Dependency to Modules:
     *
     * If a dependencies array is given, each entry represents the name of another module that the currently
     * defined module depends on. All dependency modules are loaded before the export of the currently defined
     * module is determined. The module export of each dependency module will be provided as a parameter to
     * a factory function, the order of the parameters will match the order of the modules in the dependencies
     * array.
     *
     * **Note:** The order in which the dependency modules are executed is **not** defined by the order
     * in the dependencies array! The execution order is affected by dependencies between the dependency
     * modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither
     * module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution
     * order (other than expressed by their dependencies).
     *
     * **Note:** A static module export (a literal provided to `sap.ui.define`) cannot depend on the module
     * exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved. As
     * an alternative, modules can define a factory function, calculate a static export value in that function,
     * potentially based on the dependencies, and return the result as module export value. The same approach
     * must be taken when the module export is supposed to be a function.
     *
     * Asynchronous Contract:
     *
     * `sap.ui.define` is designed to support real Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) in future, although
     * it internally still might use synchronous module loading, depending on configuration and context. However,
     * callers of `sap.ui.define` must never rely on any synchronous behavior that they might observe in a specific
     * test scenario.
     *
     * For example, callers of `sap.ui.define` must not use the module export value immediately after invoking
     * `sap.ui.define`:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // COUNTER EXAMPLE HOW __NOT__ TO DO IT
     *
     *   // define a class Something as AMD module
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', [], function() {
     *     var Something = function() {};
     *     return Something;
     *   });
     *
     *   // DON'T DO THAT!
     *   // accessing the class _synchronously_ after sap.ui.define was called
     *   new Something();
     *
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Applications that need to ensure synchronous module definition or synchronous loading of dependencies
     * **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs {@link jQuery.sap.declare} and {@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     *
     * (No) Global References:
     *
     * To be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with `sap.ui.define` should not make any use of
     * global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies
     * to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.
     *
     * As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will
     * be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel
     * to the old global names. The fourth parameter of `sap.ui.define` has been added to support that transition

     *       }
     *     }
     *   });
     *
     *   // now the module can be retrieved like other modules
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {
     *
     *     new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)

     * syntax for the module's own name as well as for its dependencies. The only difference to that syntax
     * is, that for `sap.ui.define` and `sap.ui.require`, the extension (which always would be '.js') has to
     * be omitted. Both methods always add this extension internally.
     *
     * As a convenience, the name of a dependency can start with the segment './' which will be replaced by
     * the name of the package that contains the currently defined module (relative name).
     *
     * It is best practice to omit the name of the defined module (first parameter) and to use relative names
     * for the dependencies whenever possible. This reduces the necessary configuration, simplifies renaming
     * of packages and allows to map them to a different namespace.
     *
     * Dependency to Modules:
     *
     * If a dependencies array is given, each entry represents the name of another module that the currently
     * defined module depends on. All dependency modules are loaded before the export of the currently defined
     * module is determined. The module export of each dependency module will be provided as a parameter to
     * a factory function, the order of the parameters will match the order of the modules in the dependencies
     * array.
     *
     * **Note:** The order in which the dependency modules are executed is **not** defined by the order
     * in the dependencies array! The execution order is affected by dependencies between the dependency
     * modules as well as by their current state (whether a module already has been loaded or not). Neither
     * module implementations nor dependents that require a module set must make any assumption about the execution
     * order (other than expressed by their dependencies).
     *
     * **Note:** A static module export (a literal provided to `sap.ui.define`) cannot depend on the module
     * exports of the dependency modules as it has to be calculated before the dependencies are resolved. As
     * an alternative, modules can define a factory function, calculate a static export value in that function,
     * potentially based on the dependencies, and return the result as module export value. The same approach
     * must be taken when the module export is supposed to be a function.
     *
     * Asynchronous Contract:
     *
     * `sap.ui.define` is designed to support real Asynchronous Module Definitions (AMD) in future, although
     * it internally still might use synchronous module loading, depending on configuration and context. However,
     * callers of `sap.ui.define` must never rely on any synchronous behavior that they might observe in a specific
     * test scenario.
     *
     * For example, callers of `sap.ui.define` must not use the module export value immediately after invoking
     * `sap.ui.define`:
     *
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // COUNTER EXAMPLE HOW __NOT__ TO DO IT
     *
     *   // define a class Something as AMD module
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', [], function() {
     *     var Something = function() {};
     *     return Something;
     *   });
     *
     *   // DON'T DO THAT!
     *   // accessing the class _synchronously_ after sap.ui.define was called
     *   new Something();
     *
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Applications that need to ensure synchronous module definition or synchronous loading of dependencies
     * **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs {@link jQuery.sap.declare} and {@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     *
     * (No) Global References:
     *
     * To be in line with AMD best practices, modules defined with `sap.ui.define` should not make any use of
     * global variables if those variables are also available as module exports. Instead, they should add dependencies
     * to those modules and use the corresponding parameter of the factory function to access the module exports.
     *
     * As the current programming model and the documentation of UI5 heavily rely on global names, there will
     * be a transition phase where UI5 enables AMD modules and local references to module exports in parallel
     * to the old global names. The fourth parameter of `sap.ui.define` has been added to support that transition
     * phase. When this parameter is set to true, the framework provides two additional features
     *
     *
     * 	 - Before the factory function is called, the existence of the global parent namespace for the current
     * 			module is ensured
     * 	 - The module export returned by the module's factory function will be automatically exported under
     * 			the global name which is derived from the ID of the module
     *
     * The parameter lets the framework know whether any of those two operations is needed or not. In future
     * versions of UI5, a central configuration option is planned to suppress those 'exports'.
     *
     * Third Party Modules: Although third party modules don't use UI5 APIs, they still can be listed as dependencies
     * in a `sap.ui.define` call. They will be requested and executed like UI5 modules, but to make their exports
     * available, so called ***shims*** have to be defined.
     *
     * Note that UI5 temporarily deactivates an existing AMD loader while it executes third party modules known
     * to support AMD. This sounds contradictorily at a first glance as UI5 wants to support AMD, but for now
     * it is necessary to fully support UI5 applications that rely on global names for such modules.
     *
     * For third-party modules that UI5 delivers (e.g. those in namespace `sap/ui/thirdparty/`), the necessary
     * shims are defined by UI5 itself by executing the private module `ui5loader-autoconfig.js` during bootstrap.
     *
     * Example:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   // module 'Something' wants to use third party library 'URI.js'
     *   // It is packaged by UI5 as non-UI5-module 'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'
     *   // the following shim helps UI5 to correctly load URI.js and to retrieve the module's export value
     *   // Apps don't have to define that shim, it is already applied by ui5loader-autconfig.js
     *   sap.ui.loader.config({
     *     shim: {
     *       'sap/ui/thirdparty/URI': {
     *          amd: true, // URI.js reacts on an AMD loader, this flag lets UI5 temp. disable such loaders
     *          exports: 'URI' // name of the global variable under which URI.js exports its module value
     *       }
     *     }
     *   });
     *
     *   // now the module can be retrieved like other modules
     *   sap.ui.define('Something', ['sap/ui/thirdparty/URI'], function(URIModuleValue) {
     *
     *     new URIModuleValue(...); // same as the global 'URI' name: new URI(...)
     *
     *     ...
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Differences to Standard AMD:
     *
     * The current implementation of `sap.ui.define` differs from the AMD specification (https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api)
     * or from concrete AMD loaders like `requireJS` in several aspects:
     * 	 - The name `sap.ui.define` is different from the plain `define`. This has two reasons: first, it avoids
     * 			the impression that `sap.ui.define` is an exact implementation of an AMD loader. And second, it allows
     * 			the coexistence of an AMD loader (e.g. requireJS) and `sap.ui.define` in one application as long as UI5
     * 			or applications using UI5 are not fully prepared to run with an AMD loader. Note that the difference
     * 			of the API names also implies that the UI5 loader can't be used to load 'real' AMD modules as they expect
     * 			methods `define` and `require` to be available. Modules that use Unified Module Definition (UMD) syntax,
     * 			can be loaded, but only when no AMD loader is present or when they expose their export also to the global
     * 			namespace, even when an AMD loader is present (as e.g. jQuery does) or when a shim is defined for them
     * 			using the `amd:true` flag (see example above)
     * 	 - Depending on configuration and the current context, `sap.ui.define` loads the dependencies of a module
     * 			either synchronously using a sync XHR call + eval or asynchronously via script tags. The sync loading
     * 			is basically a tribute to the synchronous history of UI5. There's no way for a module developer to enforce
     * 			synchronous loading of the dependencies and on the long run, sync loading will be faded out. Applications
     * 			that need to ensure synchronous loading of dependencies **MUST** use the deprecated legacy APIs like
     * 			{@link jQuery.sap.require}.
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support plugins to use other file types, formats or protocols. It is not
     * 			planned to support this in future
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does not support absolute URLs as module names (dependencies) nor does it allow module
     * 			names that start with a slash. To refer to a module at an absolute URL, a resource root can be registered
     * 			that points to that URL (or to a prefix of it).
     * 	 - `sap.ui.define` does **not** support the 'sugar' of requireJS where CommonJS style dependency declarations
     * 			using `sap.ui.require("something")` are automagically converted into `sap.ui.define` dependencies before
     * 			executing the factory function.
     *
     * Restrictions, Design Considerations:
     * 	 - **Restriction**: as dependency management is not supported for Non-UI5 modules, the only way to ensure
     * 			proper execution order for such modules currently is to rely on the order in the dependency array. Obviously,
     * 			this only works as long as `sap.ui.define` uses synchronous loading. It will be enhanced when asynchronous
     * 			loading is implemented.
     * 	 - It was discussed to enforce asynchronous execution of the module factory function (e.g. with a timeout
     * 			of 0). But this would have invalidated the current migration scenario where a sync `jQuery.sap.require`
     * 			call can load a `sap.ui.define`'ed module. If the module definition would not execute synchronously,
     * 			the synchronous contract of the require call would be broken (default behavior in existing UI5 applications)
     *
     * 	 - A single file must not contain multiple calls to `sap.ui.define`. Multiple calls currently are only
     * 			supported in the so called 'preload' files that the UI5 merge tooling produces. The exact details of
     * 			how this works might be changed in future implementations and are not part of the API contract
     * See:
     * 	https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api

     * Creates a Template for the given ID, DOM reference or a configuration object.
     *
     * If no parameter is defined, this function makes a lookup of DOM elements which are specifying a type
     * attribute. If the value of this type attribute matches a registered type then the content of this DOM
     * element will be used to create a new `Template` instance.
     *
     * If you want to lookup all kind of existing and known templates and parse them directly you can simply
     * call:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   sap.ui.template();
     * ```
     *
     *
     * To parse a concrete DOM element you can do so by using this function in the following way:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   sap.ui.template("theTemplateId");
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Or you can pass the reference to a DOM element and use this DOM element as a source for the template:
     *
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   sap.ui.template(oDomRef);
     * ```
     *
     *
     * The last option to use this function is to pass the information via a configuration object. This configuration
     * object can be used to pass a context for the templating framework when compiling the template:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   var oTemplateById = sap.ui.template({
     *     id: "theTemplateId",
     *     context: { ... }
     *   });
     *
     *   var oTemplateByDomRef = sap.ui.template({
     *     domref: oDomRef,
     *     context: { ... }
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * It can also be used to load a template from another file:
     * ```javascript
     *
     *   var oTemplate = sap.ui.template({
     *     id: "myTemplate",
     *     src: "myTemplate.tmpl"
     *   });
     *
     *   var oTemplateWithContext = sap.ui.template({
     *     id: "myTemplate",
     *     src: "myTemplate.tmpl",
     *     context: { ... }
     *   });

     *
     * The `vView` can either be the name of the module that contains the view definition or it can be a configuration
     * object with properties `viewName`, `viewContent` and a `controller` property (more properties are described
     * in the parameters section below).
     *
     * If a `viewName` is given, it behaves the same as when `vView` is a string: the named resource will be
     * loaded and parsed as XML. Alternatively, an already loaded view definition can be provided as `viewContent`,
     * either as XML string or as an already parsed XML document. Exactly one of `viewName` and `viewContent`
     * must be given, if none or both are given, an error will be reported. The `controller` property is optional
     * and can hold a controller instance. When given, it overrides the controller class defined in the view
     * definition.
     *
     * When property `async` is set to true, the view definition and the controller class (and its dependencies)
     * will be loaded asynchronously. Any controls used in the view might be loaded sync or async, depending
     * on the processingMode. Even when the view definition is provided as string or XML Document, controller
     * or controls might be loaded asynchronously. In any case a view instance will be returned synchronously
     * by this factory API, but its content (control tree) might appear only later. Also see {@link sap.ui.core.mvc.View#loaded}.
     *
     * **Note**: If an XML document is given, it might be modified during view construction.
     *
     * **Note**: On root level, you can only define content for the default aggregation, e.g. without adding
     * the `<content>` tag. If you want to specify content for another aggregation of a view like `dependents`,
     * place it in a child control's dependents aggregation or add it by using {@link sap.ui.core.mvc.XMLView#addDependent}.
     *

     * takes only place if the UI5 version or the component descriptor (manifest.json) change. This is still
     * an experimental feature and may experience slight changes of the invalidation parameters or the cache
     * key format.

       * API provides functions to the application which allow it to add, remove or change style classes for the
       * control. In general, this option is not available for elements because elements do not necessarily have
       * a representation in the DOM.
       *
       * This function can be used by a control developer to explicitly enrich the API of his/her element implementation
       * with the API functions for the custom style class support. It must be called on the prototype of the
       * element.
       *
       * **Usage Example:**
       * ```javascript
       *
       * sap.ui.define(['sap/ui/core/Element', 'sap/ui/core/CustomStyleClassSupport'], function(Element, CustomStyleClassSupport) {
       *    "use strict";
       *    var MyElement = Element.extend("my.MyElement", {
       *       metadata : {
       *          //...
       *       }
       *       //...
       *    });
       *
       *    CustomStyleClassSupport.apply(MyElement.prototype);
       *
       *    return MyElement;
       * }, true);
       * ```
       *
       *
       * Furthermore, the function `oRenderManager.writeClasses(oElement);` ({@link sap.ui.core.RenderManager#writeClasses})
       * must be called within the renderer of the control to which the element belongs, when writing the root
       * tag of the element. This ensures the classes are written to the HTML.
       *
       * This function adds the following functions to the elements prototype:
       * 	 - `addStyleClass`: {@link sap.ui.core.Control#addStyleClass}
       * 	 - `removeStyleClass`: {@link sap.ui.core.Control#removeStyleClass}
       * 	 - `toggleStyleClass`: {@link sap.ui.core.Control#toggleStyleClass}
       * 	 - `hasStyleClass`: {@link sap.ui.core.Control#hasStyleClass}  In addition the clone function of
       * 			the element is extended to ensure that the custom style classes are also available on the cloned element.
       *
       * **Note:** This function can only be used within control development. An application cannot add
       * style class support on existing elements by calling this function.
