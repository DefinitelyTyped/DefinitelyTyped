   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * Displays a group of avatars arranged horizontally. It is useful to visually showcase a group of related
   * avatars, such as, project team members or employees.
   *
   * The component allows you to display the avatars in different sizes, depending on your use case.
   *
   * The `AvatarGroup` component has two group types:
   * 	 - `Group` type: The avatars are displayed as partially overlapped on top of each other and the entire
   * 			group has one click/tap area.
   * 	 - `Individual` type: The avatars are displayed side-by-side and each avatar has its own click/tap area.
   *
   *
   * Responsive Behavior:
   *
   * When the available space is less than the width required to display all avatars, an overflow visualization
   * appears as a button placed at the end with the same shape and size as the avatars. The visualization
   * displays the number of avatars that have overflowed and are not currently visible.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * Use the `AvatarGroup` if:
   * 	 - You want to display a group of avatars.
   * 	 - You want to display several avatars which have something in common.
   *
   * Do not use the `AvatarGroup` if:
   * 	 - You want to display a single avatar.
   * 	 - You want to display a gallery for simple images.
   * 	 - You want to use it for other visual content than avatars.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling: The component provides advanced keyboard handling. When focused, the user can use
   * the following keyboard shortcuts in order to perform a navigation:
   *  - `type` Individual:
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 - [TAB] - Move focus to the overflow button
   * 	 - [LEFT] - Navigate one avatar to the left
   * 	 - [RIGHT] - Navigate one avatar to the right
   * 	 - [HOME] - Navigate to the first avatar
   * 	 - [END] - Navigate to the last avatar
   * 	 - [SPACE],[ENTER],[RETURN] - Trigger `ui5-click` event
   *  - `type` Group:
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 - [TAB] - Move focus to the next interactive element after the component
   * 	 - [SPACE],[ENTER],[RETURN] - Trigger `ui5-click` event

   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.BusyIndicator` signals that some operation is going on and that the user must wait.
   * It does not block the current UI screen so other operations could be triggered in parallel. It displays
   * 3 dots and each dot expands and shrinks at a different rate, resulting in a cascading flow of animation.
   *
   * Usage: For the `sap.ui.webc.main.BusyIndicator` you can define the size, the text and whether it is shown
   * or hidden. In order to hide it, use the "active" property.
   *
   *  In order to show busy state over an HTML element, simply nest the HTML element in a `sap.ui.webc.main.BusyIndicator`
   * instance.
   *  **Note:** Since `sap.ui.webc.main.BusyIndicator` has `display: inline-block;` by default and no width
   * of its own, whenever you need to wrap a block-level element, you should set `display: block` to the busy
   * indicator as well.
   *
   * When to use::
   * 	 - The user needs to be able to cancel the operation.
   * 	 - Only part of the application or a particular component is affected.
   *
   * When not to use::
   * 	 - The operation takes less than one second.
   * 	 - You need to block the screen and prevent the user from starting another activity.
   * 	 - Do not show multiple busy indicators at once.

   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.Button` component represents a simple push button. It enables users to trigger
   * actions by clicking or tapping the `sap.ui.webc.main.Button`, or by pressing certain keyboard keys, such
   * as Enter.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * For the `sap.ui.webc.main.Button` UI, you can define text, icon, or both. You can also specify whether
   * the text or the icon is displayed first.
   *
   *  You can choose from a set of predefined types that offer different styling to correspond to the triggered
   * action.
   *
   *  You can set the `sap.ui.webc.main.Button` as enabled or disabled. An enabled `sap.ui.webc.main.Button`
   * can be pressed by clicking or tapping it. The button changes its style to provide visual feedback to
   * the user that it is pressed or hovered over with the mouse cursor. A disabled `sap.ui.webc.main.Button`
   * appears inactive and cannot be pressed.
   *
   * CSS Shadow Parts:
   *
   * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part CSS Shadow Parts} allow developers to
   * style elements inside the Shadow DOM.
   *  The `sap.ui.webc.main.Button` exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts:

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.Calendar` component allows users to select one or more dates.
   *
   *  Currently selected dates are represented with instances of `sap.ui.webc.main.CalendarDate` as children
   * of the `sap.ui.webc.main.Calendar`. The value property of each `sap.ui.webc.main.CalendarDate` must be
   * a date string, correctly formatted according to the `sap.ui.webc.main.Calendar`'s `formatPattern` property.
   * Whenever the user changes the date selection, `sap.ui.webc.main.Calendar` will automatically create/remove
   * instances of `sap.ui.webc.main.CalendarDate` in itself, unless you prevent this behavior by calling `preventDefault()`
   * for the `selected-dates-change` event. This is useful if you want to control the selected dates externally.
   *
   *
   *
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * The user can navigate to a particular date by:
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 - Pressing over a month inside the months view
   * 	 - Pressing over an year inside the years view
   *  The user can confirm a date selection by pressing over a date inside the days view.
   *
   *
   *
   * Keyboard Handling: The `sap.ui.webc.main.Calendar` provides advanced keyboard handling. When a picker
   * is showed and focused the user can use the following keyboard shortcuts in order to perform a navigation:
   *
   *  - Day picker:
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 - [F4] - Shows month picker
   * 	 - [SHIFT] + [F4] - Shows year picker
   * 	 - [PAGEUP] - Navigate to the previous month
   * 	 - [PAGEDOWN] - Navigate to the next month
   * 	 - [SHIFT] + [PAGEUP] - Navigate to the previous year
   * 	 - [SHIFT] + [PAGEDOWN] - Navigate to the next year
   * 	 - [CTRL] + [SHIFT] + [PAGEUP] - Navigate ten years backwards
   * 	 - [CTRL] + [SHIFT] + [PAGEDOWN] - Navigate ten years forwards
   * 	 - [HOME] - Navigate to the first day of the week
   * 	 - [END] - Navigate to the last day of the week
   * 	 - [CTRL] + [HOME] - Navigate to the first day of the month
   * 	 - [CTRL] + [END] - Navigate to the last day of the month
   *  - Month picker:
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 - [PAGEUP] - Navigate to the previous year
   * 	 - [PAGEDOWN] - Navigate to the next year
   * 	 - [HOME] - Navigate to the first month of the current row
   * 	 - [END] - Navigate to the last month of the current row
   * 	 - [CTRL] + [HOME] - Navigate to the first month of the current year
   * 	 - [CTRL] + [END] - Navigate to the last month of the year
   *  - Year picker:
   *

   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.Card` is a component that represents information in the form of a tile with separate
   * header and content areas. The content area of a `sap.ui.webc.main.Card` can be arbitrary HTML content.
   * The header can be used through slot `header`. For which there is a `sap.ui.webc.main.CardHeader` component
   * to achieve the card look and fill.
   *
   * Note: We recommend the usage of `sap.ui.webc.main.CardHeader` for the header slot, so advantage can be
   * taken for keyboard handling, styling and accessibility.
   *
   * CSS Shadow Parts:
   *
   * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part CSS Shadow Parts} allow developers to
   * style elements inside the Shadow DOM.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview: The Carousel allows the user to browse through a set of items. The component is mostly used
   * for showing a gallery of images, but can hold any other HTML element.
   *  There are several ways to perform navigation:
   * 	 - on desktop - the user can navigate using the navigation arrows or with keyboard shorcuts.
   * 	 - on mobile - the user can use swipe gestures.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * When to use::
   *
   *
   * 	 - The items you want to display are very different from each other.
   * 	 - You want to display the items one after the other.
   *
   * When not to use::
   *
   *
   * 	 - The items you want to display need to be visible at the same time.
   * 	 - The items you want to display are uniform and very similar.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling:
   *
   * Basic Navigation: When the `sap.ui.webc.main.Carousel` is focused the user can navigate between the items
   * with the following keyboard shortcuts:
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 - [UP/DOWN] - Navigates to previous and next item
   * 	 - [LEFT/RIGHT] - Navigates to previous and next item

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * Allows the user to set a binary value, such as true/false or yes/no for an item.
   *
   *  The `sap.ui.webc.main.CheckBox` component consists of a box and a label that describes its purpose.
   * If it's checked, an indicator is displayed inside the box. To check/uncheck the `sap.ui.webc.main.CheckBox`,
   * the user has to click or tap the square box or its label.
   *
   *  The `sap.ui.webc.main.CheckBox` component only has 2 states - checked and unchecked. Clicking or tapping
   * toggles the `sap.ui.webc.main.CheckBox` between checked and unchecked state.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * You can define the checkbox text with via the `text` property. If the text exceeds the available width,
   * it is truncated by default. In case you prefer text to wrap, set the `wrappingType` property to "Normal".
   * The touchable area for toggling the `sap.ui.webc.main.CheckBox` ends where the text ends.
   *
   *  You can disable the `sap.ui.webc.main.CheckBox` by setting the `disabled` property to `true`, or use
   * the `sap.ui.webc.main.CheckBox` in read-only mode by setting the `readonly` property to `true`.
   *
   *
   *
   *  Keyboard Handling:
   *
   * The user can use the following keyboard shortcuts to toggle the checked state of the `sap.ui.webc.main.CheckBox`.
   *
   * 	 - [SPACE, ENTER] - Toggles between different states: checked, not checked.

   * and a text input field to narrow down the options.
   *
   * It is commonly used to enable users to select an option from a predefined list.

   * Structure: The `sap.ui.webc.main.ComboBox` consists of the following elements:
   * 	 -  Input field - displays the selected option or a custom user entry. Users can type to narrow down
   * 			the list or enter their own value.  Drop-down arrow - expands\collapses the option list.
   * 	 -  Option list - the list of available options.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.ComboBox` provides advanced keyboard handling.
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 - [F4], [ALT]+[UP], or [ALT]+[DOWN] - Toggles the picker.
   * 	 - [ESC] - Closes the picker, if open. If closed, cancels changes and reverts the typed in value.
   * 	 - [ENTER] or [RETURN] - If picker is open, takes over the currently selected item and closes it.
   * 	 - [DOWN] - Selects the next matching item in the picker.
   * 	 - [UP] - Selects the previous matching item in the picker.
   * 	 - [PAGEDOWN] - Moves selection down by page size (10 items by default).
   * 	 - [PAGEUP] - Moves selection up by page size (10 items by default).
   * 	 - [HOME] - If focus is in the ComboBox, moves cursor at the beginning of text. If focus is in the picker,
   * 			selects the first item.
   * 	 - [END] - If focus is in the ComboBox, moves cursor at the end of text. If focus is in the picker,

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.DatePicker` component provides an input field with assigned calendar which opens
   * on user action. The `sap.ui.webc.main.DatePicker` allows users to select a localized date using touch,
   * mouse, or keyboard input. It consists of two parts: the date input field and the date picker.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * The user can enter a date by:
   * 	 - Using the calendar that opens in a popup
   * 	 - Typing it in directly in the input field
   *
   *  When the user makes an entry and presses the enter key, the calendar shows the corresponding date. When
   * the user directly triggers the calendar display, the actual date is displayed.
   *
   * Formatting:
   *
   * If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format.
   *
   *  Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. For more information,
   * see {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table UTS #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup
   * Language}.
   *
   *  For example, if the `format-pattern` is "yyyy-MM-dd", a valid value string is "2015-07-30" and the same
   * is displayed in the input.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling: The `sap.ui.webc.main.DatePicker` provides advanced keyboard handling. If the `sap.ui.webc.main.DatePicker`
   * is focused, you can open or close the drop-down by pressing `F4`, `ALT+UP` or `ALT+DOWN` keys. Once the
   * drop-down is opened, you can use the `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` arrow keys to navigate through the
   * dates and select one by pressing the `Space` or `Enter` keys. Moreover you can use TAB to reach the buttons
   * for changing month and year.
   *
   *
   * If the `sap.ui.webc.main.DatePicker` input field is focused and its corresponding picker dialog is not
   * opened, then users can increment or decrement the date referenced by `dateValue` property by using the
   * following shortcuts:
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 - [PAGEDOWN] - Decrements the corresponding day of the month by one
   * 	 - [SHIFT] + [PAGEDOWN] - Decrements the corresponding month by one
   * 	 - [SHIFT] + [CTRL] + [PAGEDOWN] - Decrements the corresponding year by one
   * 	 - [PAGEUP] - Increments the corresponding day of the month by one
   * 	 - [SHIFT] + [PAGEUP] - Increments the corresponding month by one
   * 	 - [SHIFT] + [CTRL] + [PAGEUP] - Increments the corresponding year by one
   *
   * Calendar types: The component supports several calendar types - Gregorian, Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese
   * and Persian. By default the Gregorian Calendar is used. In order to use the Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese
   * or Persian calendar, you need to set the `primaryCalendarType` property and import one or more of the
   * following modules:
   *
   *
   *
   * Or, you can use the global configuration and set the `calendarType` key:
   *
   * ```javascript
   * <script data-id="sap-ui-config" type="application/json">
   * {
   * 	"calendarType": "Japanese"
   * }
   * </script>```

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview: The `DateTimePicker` component alows users to select both date (day, month and year) and time
   * (hours, minutes and seconds) and for the purpose it consists of input field and Date/Time picker.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * Use the `DateTimePicker` if you need a combined date and time input component. Don't use it if you want
   * to use either date, or time value. In this case, use the `DatePicker` or the `TimePicker` components
   * instead.
   *
   *  The user can set date/time by:
   * 	 - using the calendar and the time selectors
   * 	 - typing in the input field
   *
   * Programatically, to set date/time for the `DateTimePicker`, use the `value` property
   *
   * Formatting:
   *
   * The value entered by typing into the input field must fit to the used date/time format.
   *
   *  Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. For more information,
   * see {@link https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table UTS #35: Unicode
   * Locale Data Markup Language}.
   *
   *  **Example:** the following format `dd/MM/yyyy, hh:mm:ss aa` corresponds the `13/04/2020, 03:16:16 AM`
   * value.
   *  The small 'h' defines "12" hours format and the "aa" symbols - "AM/PM" time periods.
   *
   *
   *
   *  **Example:** the following format `dd/MM/yyyy, HH:mm:ss` corresponds the `13/04/2020, 15:16:16` value.
   *
   *  The capital 'H' indicates "24" hours format.
   *
   *
   *
   *  **Note:** If the `formatPattern` does NOT include time, the `DateTimePicker` will fallback to the default
   * time format according to the locale.
   *
   *
   *
   *  **Note:** If no placeholder is set to the `DateTimePicker`, the current `formatPattern` is displayed
   * as a placeholder. If another placeholder is needed, it must be set or in case no placeholder is needed
   * - it can be set to an empty string.
   *
   *
   *
   *  **Note:** If the user input does NOT match the `formatPattern`, the `DateTimePicker` makes an attempt
   * to parse it based on the locale settings.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * The `DateTimePicker` is responsive and fully adapts to all devices. For larger screens, such as tablet
   * or desktop, it is displayed as a popover, while on phone devices, it is displayed full screen.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview: The `sap.ui.webc.main.Dialog` component is used to temporarily display some information in
   * a size-limited window in front of the regular app screen. It is used to prompt the user for an action
   * or a confirmation. The `sap.ui.webc.main.Dialog` interrupts the current app processing as it is the only
   * focused UI element and the main screen is dimmed/blocked. The dialog combines concepts known from other
   * technologies where the windows have names such as dialog box, dialog window, pop-up, pop-up window, alert
   * box, or message box.
   *
   *  The `sap.ui.webc.main.Dialog` is modal, which means that user action is required before returning to
   * the parent window is possible. The content of the `sap.ui.webc.main.Dialog` is fully customizable.
   *
   * Structure: A `sap.ui.webc.main.Dialog` consists of a header, content, and a footer for action buttons.
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.Dialog` is usually displayed at the center of the screen. Its position can be changed
   * by the user. To enable this, you need to set the property `draggable` accordingly.
   *
   * Responsive Behavior: The `stretch` property can be used to stretch the `sap.ui.webc.main.Dialog` on full
   * screen.
   *
   * CSS Shadow Parts:
   *
   * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part CSS Shadow Parts} allow developers to
   * style elements inside the Shadow DOM.
   *  The `sap.ui.webc.main.Dialog` exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts:
   * 	 - header - Used to style the header of the component
   * 	 - content - Used to style the content of the component
   * 	 - footer - Used to style the footer of the component
   *
   * **Note:** We don't recommend nesting popup-like components (`sap.ui.webc.main.Dialog`, `sap.ui.webc.main.Popover`)
   * inside `sap.ui.webc.main.Dialog`. Ideally you should create all popups on the same level inside your
   * HTML page and just open them from one another, rather than nesting them.
   *
   * **Note:** We don't recommend nesting popup-like components (`sap.ui.webc.main.Dialog`, `sap.ui.webc.main.Popover`)
   * inside other components containing z-index. This might break z-index management.

   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.FileUploader` opens a file explorer dialog and enables users to upload files. The
   * component consists of input field, but you can provide an HTML element by your choice to trigger the
   * file upload, by using the default slot. Furthermore, you can set the property "hideInput" to "true" to
   * hide the input field.
   *  To get all selected files, you can simply use the read-only "files" property. To restrict the types
   * of files the user can select, you can use the "accept" property.
   *  And, similar to all input based components, the FileUploader supports "valueState", "placeholder", "name",
   * and "disabled" properties.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.Icon` component represents an SVG icon. There are two main scenarios how the `sap.ui.webc.main.Icon`
   * component is used: as a purely decorative element,
   *  or as an interactive element that can be focused and clicked.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * 1. **Get familiar with the icons collections.**
   *  Before displaying an icon, you need to explore the icons collections to find and import the desired
   * icon.
   *  Currently there are 3 icons collection, available as 3 npm packages:
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 -  {@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents-icons @ui5/webcomponents-icons} represents
   * 			the "SAP-icons" collection and includes the following {@link demo:sap/m/demokit/iconExplorer/webapp/index.html#/overview/SAP-icons
   * 			icons}.
   * 	 -  {@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt @ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt}
   * 			represents the "tnt" collection and includes the following {@link demo:sap/m/demokit/iconExplorer/webapp/index.html#/overview/SAP-icons-TNT
   * 			icons}.
   * 	 -  {@link https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite @ui5/webcomponents-icons-icons-business-suite}
   * 			represents the "business-suite" collection and includes the following {@link https://ui5.sap.com/test-resources/sap/m/demokit/iconExplorer/webapp/index.html#/overview/BusinessSuiteInAppSymbols
   * 			icons}.
   *
   * 2. **After exploring the icons collections, add one or more of the packages as dependencies to your project.**
   *
   *  `npm i @ui5/webcomponents-icons`
   *  `npm i @ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt`
   *  `npm i @ui5/webcomponents-icons-business-suite`
   *
   *
   *
   * **For Example**:
   *
   *
   * 4. **Display the icon using the `sap.ui.webc.main.Icon` web component.**
   *  Set the icon collection ("SAP-icons", "tnt" or "business-suite" - "SAP-icons" is the default icon collection
   * and can be skipped)
   *  and the icon name to the `name` property.
   *
   *
   *
   * `<ui5-icon name="employee"></ui5-icon>`
   *  `<ui5-icon name="tnt/antenna"></ui5-icon>`
   *  `<ui5-icon name="business-suite/ab-testing"></ui5-icon>`
   *
   * Keyboard Handling:
   *
   *
   * 	 - [SPACE, ENTER, RETURN] - Fires the `click` event if the `interactive` property is set to true.
   * 	 - [SHIFT] - If [SPACE] or [ENTER],[RETURN] is pressed, pressing [SHIFT] releases the ui5-icon without
   * 			triggering the click event.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.Input` component allows the user to enter and edit text or numeric values in one
   * line.
   *  Additionally, you can provide `suggestionItems`, that are displayed in a popover right under the input.
   *
   *
   *  The text field can be editable or read-only (`readonly` property), and it can be enabled or disabled
   * (`disabled` property). To visualize semantic states, such as "error" or "warning", the `valueState` property
   * is provided. When the user makes changes to the text, the change event is fired, which enables you to
   * react on any text change.
   *
   *  **Note:** If you are using the `sap.ui.webc.main.Input` as a single npm module, don't forget to import
   * the `InputSuggestions` module from "@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/InputSuggestions.js" to enable the
   * suggestions functionality.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling: The `sap.ui.webc.main.Input` provides the following keyboard shortcuts:
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 - [ESC] - Closes the suggestion list, if open. If closed or not enabled, cancels changes and reverts
   * 			to the value which the Input field had when it got the focus.
   * 	 - [ENTER] or [RETURN] - If suggestion list is open takes over the current matching item and closes
   * 			it. If value state or group header is focused, does nothing.
   * 	 - [DOWN] - Focuses the next matching item in the suggestion list.
   * 	 - [UP] - Focuses the previous matching item in the suggestion list.
   * 	 - [HOME] - If focus is in the text input, moves caret before the first character. If focus is in the
   * 			list, highlights the first item and updates the input accordingly.
   * 	 - [END] - If focus is in the text input, moves caret after the last character. If focus is in the list,
   * 			highlights the last item and updates the input accordingly.
   * 	 - [PAGEUP] - If focus is in the list, moves highlight up by page size (10 items by default). If focus
   * 			is in the input, does nothing.
   * 	 - [PAGEDOWN] - If focus is in the list, moves highlight down by page size (10 items by default). If
   * 			focus is in the input, does nothing.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview: The `sap.ui.webc.main.Link` is a hyperlink component that is used to navigate to other apps
   * and web pages, or to trigger actions. It is a clickable text element, visualized in such a way that it
   * stands out from the standard text. On hover, it changes its style to an underlined text to provide additional
   * feedback to the user.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * You can set the `sap.ui.webc.main.Link` to be enabled or disabled.
   *
   *  To create a visual hierarchy in large lists of links, you can set the less important links as `Subtle`
   * or the more important ones as `Emphasized`, by using the `design` property.
   *
   *  If the `href` property is set, the link behaves as the HTML anchor tag (`<a><a/>`) and
   * opens the specified URL in the given target frame (`target` property). To specify where the linked content
   * is opened, you can use the `target` property.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * If there is not enough space, the text of the `sap.ui.webc.main.Link` becomes truncated. If the `wrappingType`
   * property is set to `"Normal"`, the text is displayed on several lines instead of being truncated.

   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.List` component allows displaying a list of items, advanced keyboard handling support
   * for navigating between items, and predefined modes to improve the development efficiency.
   *
   *  The `sap.ui.webc.main.List` is a container for the available list items:
   * 	 - `sap.ui.webc.main.StandardListItem`
   * 	 - `sap.ui.webc.main.CustomListItem`
   * 	 - `sap.ui.webc.main.GroupHeaderListItem`
   *
   *  To benefit from the built-in selection mechanism, you can use the available selection modes, such as
   * `SingleSelect`, `MultiSelect` and `Delete`.
   *
   *  Additionally, the `sap.ui.webc.main.List` provides header, footer, and customization for the list item
   * separators.
   *
   *
   *
   *  Keyboard Handling:
   *
   * Basic Navigation: The `sap.ui.webc.main.List` provides advanced keyboard handling. When a list is focused
   * the user can use the following keyboard shortcuts in order to perform a navigation:
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 - [UP/DOWN] - Navigates up and down the items
   * 	 - [HOME] - Navigates to first item
   * 	 - [END] - Navigates to the last item
   *
   * The user can use the following keyboard shortcuts to perform actions (such as select, delete), when the
   * `mode` property is in use:
   * 	 - [SPACE] - Select an item (if `type` is 'Active') when `mode` is selection
   * 	 - [DELETE] - Delete an item if `mode` property is `Delete`

   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.MultiComboBox` component consists of a list box with items and a text field allowing
   * the user to either type a value directly into the text field, or choose from the list of existing items.
   *
   * The drop-down list is used for selecting and filtering values, it enables users to select one or more
   * options from a predefined list. The control provides an editable input field to filter the list, and
   * a dropdown arrow to expand/collapse the list of available options. The options in the list have checkboxes
   * that permit multi-selection. Entered values are displayed as tokens. Structure: The `sap.ui.webc.main.MultiComboBox`
   * consists of the following elements:
   * 	 -  Tokenizer - a list of tokens with selected options.  Input field - displays the selected option/s
   * 			as token/s. Users can type to filter the list.  Drop-down arrow - expands\collapses the option list.
   *
   * 	 -  Option list - the list of available options.  Keyboard Handling:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.MultiComboBox` provides advanced keyboard handling.
   *
   * Picker: If the `sap.ui.webc.main.MultiComboBox` is focused, you can open or close the drop-down by pressing
   * `F4`, `ALT+UP` or `ALT+DOWN` keys. Once the drop-down is opened, you can use the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow
   * keys to navigate through the available options and select one by pressing the `Space` or `Enter` keys.
   *
   *
   *
   * Tokens:
   * 	 -  Left/Right arrow keys - moves the focus selection form the currently focused token to the previous/next
   * 			one (if available).
   * 	 -  Delete - deletes the token and focuses the previous token.
   * 	 -  Backspace - deletes the token and focus the next token.

   * Overview: A `sap.ui.webc.main.MultiInput` field allows the user to enter multiple values, which are displayed
   * as `sap.ui.webc.main.Token`.
   *
   * User can choose interaction for creating tokens. Fiori Guidelines say that user should create tokens
   * when:
   * 	 - Type a value in the input and press enter or focus out the input field (`change` event is fired)
   * 			Select a value from the suggestion list (`suggestion-item-select` event is fired)

   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.Panel` component is a container which has a header and a content area and is used
   * for grouping and displaying information. It can be collapsed to save space on the screen.
   *
   * Guidelines::
   * 	 - Nesting two or more panels is not recommended.
   * 	 - Do not stack too many panels on one page.
   *
   * Structure: The panel's header area consists of a title bar with a header text or custom header.
   *  The header is clickable and can be used to toggle between the expanded and collapsed state. It includes
   * an icon which rotates depending on the state.
   *  The custom header can be set through the `header` slot and it may contain arbitraray content, such as:
   * title, buttons or any other HTML elements.
   *  The content area can contain an arbitrary set of controls.
   *  **Note:** The custom header is not clickable out of the box, but in this case the icon is interactive
   * and allows to show/hide the content area.
   *
   * Responsive Behavior:
   * 	 - If the width of the panel is set to 100% (default), the panel and its children are resized responsively,
   * 			depending on its parent container.
   * 	 - If the panel has a fixed height, it will take up the space even if the panel is collapsed.
   * 	 - When the panel is expandable (the `fixed` property is set to `false`), an arrow icon (pointing to
   * 			the right) appears in front of the header.
   * 	 - When the animation is activated, expand/collapse uses a smooth animation to open or close the content
   * 			area.
   * 	 - When the panel expands/collapses, the arrow icon rotates 90 degrees clockwise/counter-clockwise.
   *
   *
   * CSS Shadow Parts:
   *
   * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part CSS Shadow Parts} allow developers to
   * style elements inside the Shadow DOM.
   *  The `sap.ui.webc.main.Panel` exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts:
   * 	 - header - Used to style the wrapper of the header
   * 	 - content - Used to style the wrapper of the content

   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.Popover` component displays additional information for an object in a compact way
   * and without leaving the page. The Popover can contain various UI elements, such as fields, tables, images,
   * and charts. It can also include actions in the footer.
   *
   * Structure:
   *
   * The popover has three main areas:
   * 	 - Header (optional)
   * 	 - Content
   * 	 - Footer (optional)
   *
   * **Note:** The `sap.ui.webc.main.Popover` is closed when the user clicks or taps outside the popover or
   * selects an action within the popover. You can prevent this with the `modal` property.
   *
   * CSS Shadow Parts:
   *
   * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part CSS Shadow Parts} allow developers to
   * style elements inside the Shadow DOM.
   *  The `sap.ui.webc.main.Popover` exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts:
   * 	 - header - Used to style the header of the component
   * 	 - content - Used to style the content of the component
   * 	 - footer - Used to style the footer of the component

   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.RadioButton` component enables users to select a single option from a set of options.
   * When a `sap.ui.webc.main.RadioButton` is selected by the user, the `change` event is fired. When a `sap.ui.webc.main.RadioButton`
   * that is within a group is selected, the one that was previously selected gets automatically deselected.
   * You can group radio buttons by using the `name` property.
   *  **Note:** If `sap.ui.webc.main.RadioButton` is not part of a group, it can be selected once, but can
   * not be deselected back.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling:
   *
   * Once the `sap.ui.webc.main.RadioButton` is on focus, it might be selected by pressing the Space and Enter
   * keys.
   *  The Arrow Down/Arrow Up and Arrow Left/Arrow Right keys can be used to change selection between next/previous
   * radio buttons in one group, while TAB and SHIFT + TAB can be used to enter or leave the radio button
   * group.
   *  **Note:** On entering radio button group, the focus goes to the currently selected radio button.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview: Represents a numerical interval and two handles (grips) to select a sub-range within it. The
   * purpose of the component to enable visual selection of sub-ranges within a given interval.
   *
   * Structure: The most important properties of the Range Slider are:
   * 	 - min - The minimum value of the slider range.
   * 	 - max - The maximum value of the slider range.
   * 	 - value - The current value of the slider.
   * 	 - step - Determines the increments in which the slider will move.
   * 	 - showTooltip - Determines if a tooltip should be displayed above the handle.
   * 	 - showTickmarks - Displays a visual divider between the step values.
   * 	 - labelInterval - Labels some or all of the tickmarks with their values.  Notes::
   * 	 - The right and left handle can be moved individually and their positions could therefore switch.
   * 	 - The entire range can be moved along the interval.  Usage: The most common use case is to select
   * 			and move sub-ranges on a continuous numerical scale.
   *
   * Responsive Behavior: You can move the currently selected range by clicking on it and dragging it along
   * the interval.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling:
   *
   *
   * 	 - `Left or Down Arrow` - Moves a component's handle or the entire selection one step to the left;
   * 	 - `Right or Up Arrow` - Moves a component's handle or the entire selection one step to the right;
   * 	 - `Left or Down Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd` - Moves a component's handle to the left or the entire range with
   * 			step equal to 1/10th of the entire range;
   * 	 - `Right or Up Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd` - Moves a component's handle to the right or the entire range with
   * 			step equal to 1/10th of the entire range;
   * 	 - `Plus` - Same as `Right or Up Arrow`;
   * 	 - `Minus` - Same as `Left or Down Arrow`;
   * 	 - `Home` - Moves the entire selection or the selected handle to the beginning of the component's range;
   *
   * 	 - `End` - Moves the entire selection or the selected handle to the end of the component's range;
   * 	 - `Page Up` - Same as `Right or Up Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd`;
   * 	 - `Page Down` - Same as `Left or Down Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd`;
   * 	 - `Escape` - Resets the `startValue` and `endValue` properties to the values prior the component focusing;

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview: The Rating Indicator is used to display a specific number of icons that are used to rate an
   * item. Additionally, it is also used to display the average and overall ratings.
   *
   * Usage: The recommended number of icons is between 5 and 7.
   *
   * Responsive Behavior: You can change the size of the Rating Indicator by changing its `font-size` CSS
   * property.
   *  Example: `<ui5-rating-indicator style="font-size: 3rem;"></ui5-rating-indicator>`
   *
   * Keyboard Handling: When the `sap.ui.webc.main.RatingIndicator` is focused, the user can change the rating
   * with the following keyboard shortcuts:
   *
   *
   *
   * 	 - [RIGHT/UP] - Increases the value of the rating by one step. If the highest value is reached, does
   * 			nothing
   * 	 - [LEFT/DOWN] - Decreases the value of the rating by one step. If the lowest value is reached, does
   * 			nothing.
   * 	 - [HOME] - Sets the lowest value.
   * 	 - [END] - Sets the highest value.
   * 	 - [SPACE/ENTER/RETURN] - Increases the value of the rating by one step. If the highest value is reached,
   * 			sets the rating to the lowest value.
   * 	 - Any number - Changes value to the corresponding number. If typed number is larger than the number
   * 			of values, sets the highest value.

   *
   * 	 - [F4, ALT+UP, ALT+DOWN, SPACE, ENTER] - Opens/closes the drop-down.
   * 	 - [UP, DOWN] - If the drop-down is closed - changes selection to the next or the previous option. If

   * 	 - [SPACE, ENTER] - If the drop-down is opened - selects the focused option.
   * 	 - [ESC] - Closes the drop-down without changing the selection.
   * 	 - [HOME] - Navigates to first option
   * 	 - [END] - Navigates to the last option

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview: The Slider component represents a numerical range and a handle (grip). The purpose of the component
   * is to enable visual selection of a value in a continuous numerical range by moving an adjustable handle.
   *
   * Structure: The most important properties of the Slider are:
   * 	 - min - The minimum value of the slider range.
   * 	 - max - The maximum value of the slider range.
   * 	 - value - The current value of the slider range.
   * 	 - step - Determines the increments in which the slider will move.
   * 	 - showTooltip - Determines if a tooltip should be displayed above the handle.
   * 	 - showTickmarks - Displays a visual divider between the step values.
   * 	 - labelInterval - Labels some or all of the tickmarks with their values.
   *
   * Usage: The most common use case is to select values on a continuous numerical scale (e.g. temperature,
   * volume, etc. ).
   *
   * Responsive Behavior: The `sap.ui.webc.main.Slider` component adjusts to the size of its parent container
   * by recalculating and resizing the width of the control. You can move the slider handle in several different
   * ways:
   * 	 - Drag and drop the handle to the desired value.
   * 	 - Click/tap on the range bar to move the handle to that location.
   *
   * CSS Shadow Parts:
   *
   * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part CSS Shadow Parts} allow developers to
   * style elements inside the Shadow DOM.
   *  The `sap.ui.webc.main.Slider` exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts:
   * 	 - progress-container - Used to style the progress container(the horizontal bar which visually represents
   * 			the range between the minimum and maximum value) of the `sap.ui.webc.main.Slider`.
   * 	 - progress-bar - Used to style the progress bar, which shows the progress of the `sap.ui.webc.main.Slider`.
   *
   * 	 - handle - Used to style the handle of the `sap.ui.webc.main.Slider`.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling:
   *
   *
   * 	 - `Left or Down Arrow` - Moves the handle one step to the left, effectively decreasing the component's
   * 			value by `step` amount;
   * 	 - `Right or Up Arrow` - Moves the handle one step to the right, effectively increasing the component's
   * 			value by `step` amount;
   * 	 - `Left or Down Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd` - Moves the handle to the left with step equal to 1/10th of the entire
   * 			range, effectively decreasing the component's value by 1/10th of the range;
   * 	 - `Right or Up Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd` - Moves the handle to the right with step equal to 1/10th of the entire
   * 			range, effectively increasing the component's value by 1/10th of the range;
   * 	 - `Plus` - Same as `Right or Up Arrow`;
   * 	 - `Minus` - Same as `Left or Down Arrow`;
   * 	 - `Home` - Moves the handle to the beginning of the range;
   * 	 - `End` - Moves the handle to the end of the range;
   * 	 - `Page Up` - Same as `Right or Up + Ctrl/Cmd`;
   * 	 - `Page Down` - Same as `Left or Down + Ctrl/Cmd`;
   * 	 - `Escape` - Resets the value property after interaction, to the position prior the component's focusing;

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.99.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.99.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * `sap.ui.webc.main.SplitButton` enables users to trigger actions. It is constructed of two separate actions
   * - default action and arrow action that can be activated by clicking or tapping, or by pressing certain
   * keyboard keys - `Space` or `Enter` for default action, and `Arrow Down` or `Arrow Up` for arrow action.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * `sap.ui.webc.main.SplitButton` consists two separate buttons:
   * 	 - for the first one (default action) you can define some `text` or an `icon`, or both. Also, it is
   * 			possible to define different icon for active state of this button - `activeIcon`.
   * 	 - the second one (arrow action) contains only `slim-arrow-down` icon.  You can choose a `design`
   * 			from a set of predefined types (the same as for ui5-button) that offer different styling to correspond
   * 			to the triggered action. Both text and arrow actions have the same design.
   *
   *  You can set the `sap.ui.webc.main.SplitButton` as enabled or disabled. Both parts of an enabled `sap.ui.webc.main.SplitButton`
   * can be pressed by clicking or tapping it, or by certain keys, which changes the style to provide visual
   * feedback to the user that it is pressed or hovered over with the mouse cursor. A disabled `sap.ui.webc.main.SplitButton`
   * appears inactive and any of the two buttons cannot be pressed.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling:
   * 	 - `Space` or `Enter` - triggers the default action
   * 	 - `Shift` or `Escape` - if `Space` is pressed, releases the default action button without triggering
   * 			the click event.
   * 	 - `Arrow Down`, `Arrow Up`, `Alt`+`Arrow Down`, `Alt`+`Arrow Up`, or `F4` - triggers the arrow action
   * 			There are separate events that are fired on activating of `sap.ui.webc.main.SplitButton` parts:
   * 	`click` for the first button (default action)
   * 	 - `arrow-click` for the second button (arrow action)

   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.StepInput` consists of an input field and buttons with icons to increase/decrease
   * the value with the predefined step.
   *
   *  The user can change the value of the component by pressing the increase/decrease buttons, by typing
   * a number directly, by using the keyboard up/down and page up/down, or by using the mouse scroll wheel.
   * Decimal values are supported.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * The default step is 1 but the app developer can set a different one.
   *
   * App developers can set a maximum and minimum value for the `StepInput`. The increase/decrease button
   * and the up/down keyboard navigation become disabled when the value reaches the max/min or a new value
   * is entered from the input which is greater/less than the max/min.
   *
   *  When to use::
   * 	 - To adjust amounts, quantities, or other values quickly.
   * 	 - To adjust values for a specific step.
   *
   * When not to use::
   * 	 - To enter a static number (for example, postal code, phone number, or ID). In this case, use the regular
   * 			`sap.ui.webc.main.Input` instead.
   * 	 - To display a value that rarely needs to be adjusted and does not pertain to a particular step. In
   * 			this case, use the regular `sap.ui.webc.main.Input` instead.
   * 	 - To enter dates and times. In this case, use date/time related components instead.

   * Overview: The `sap.ui.webc.main.Switch` component is used for changing between binary states.
   *  The component can display texts, that will be switched, based on the component state, via the `textOn`
   * and `textOff` properties, but texts longer than 3 letters will be cutted off.
   *  However, users are able to customize the width of `sap.ui.webc.main.Switch` with pure CSS (`<ui5-switch
   * style="width: 200px">`), and set widths, depending on the texts they would use.
   *  Note: the component would not automatically stretch to fit the whole text width.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling: The state can be changed by pressing the Space and Enter keys.
   *
   * CSS Shadow Parts:
   *
   * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part CSS Shadow Parts} allow developers to
   * style elements inside the Shadow DOM.
   *  The `sap.ui.webc.main.Switch` exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts:
   * 	 - slider - Used to style the track, where the handle is being slid
   * 	 - text-on - Used to style the `textOn` property text
   * 	 - text-off - Used to style the `textOff` property text

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.TabContainer` represents a collection of tabs with associated content. Navigation
   * through the tabs changes the content display of the currently active content area. A tab can be labeled
   * with text only, or icons with text.
   *
   * Structure:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.TabContainer` can hold two types of entities:
   * 	 - `sap.ui.webc.main.Tab` - contains all the information on an item (text and icon)
   * 	 - `sap.ui.webc.main.TabSeparator` - used to separate tabs with a line
   *
   * Hierarchies: Multiple sub tabs could be placed underneath one main tab. Nesting allows deeper hierarchies
   * with indentations to indicate the level of each nested tab. When a tab has both sub tabs and own content
   * its click area is split to allow the user to display the content or alternatively to expand / collapse
   * the list of sub tabs.
   *
   * CSS Shadow Parts:
   *
   * {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part CSS Shadow Parts} allow developers to
   * style elements inside the Shadow DOM.
   *  The `sap.ui.webc.main.TabContainer` exposes the following CSS Shadow Parts:
   * 	 - content - Used to style the content of the component
   *
   * Keyboard Handling:

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.Table` component provides a set of sophisticated and convenient functions for responsive
   * table design. It provides a comprehensive set of features for displaying and dealing with vast amounts
   * of data.
   *
   *  To render the `Table` properly, the order of the `columns` should match with the order of the item `cells`
   * in the `rows`.
   *
   *  Desktop and tablet devices are supported. On tablets, special consideration should be given to the number
   * of visible columns and rows due to the limited performance of some devices.
   *
   * Selection: To benefit from the selection mechanism of `sap.ui.webc.main.Table` component, you can use
   * the available selection modes: `SingleSelect` and `MultiSelect`.
   *  In additition to the used mode, you can also specify the `sap.ui.webc.main.TableRow` type choosing between
   * `Active` or `Inactive`.
   *
   *  In `SingleSelect` mode, you can select both an `Active` and `Inactive` row via mouse or by pressing
   * the `Space` or `Enter` keys.
   *  In `MultiSelect` mode, you can select both an `Active` and `Inactive` row by pressing the `Space` key
   * when a row is on focus or via mouse click over the selection checkbox of the row. In order to select
   * all the available rows at once, you can use the selection checkbox presented in the table's header.
   *
   *  **Note:** Currently, when a column is shown as a pop-in, the visual indication for selection is not
   * presented over it.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling:
   *
   *
   * 	 - [F7] - If focus is on an interactive control inside an item, moves focus to the corresponding item.
   *
   * 	 - [CTRL]+[A] - Selects all items, if MultiSelect mode is enabled.
   * 	 - [HOME]/[END] - Focuses the first/last item.
   * 	 - [PAGEUP]/[PAGEDOWN] - Moves focus up/down by page size (20 items by default).
   * 	 - [ALT]+[DOWN]/[UP] - Switches focus between header, last focused item, and More button (if applies)
   * 			in either direction.
   * 	 - [SHIFT]+[DOWN]/[UP] - Selects the next/previous item in a MultiSelect table, if the current item
   * 			is selected (Range selection). Otherwise, deselects them (Range deselection).
   * 	 - [SHIFT]+[HOME]/[END] - Range selection to the first/last item of the List.
   * 	 - [CTRL]+[HOME]/[END] - Same behavior as HOME & END.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.92.0
   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview: The `sap.ui.webc.main.TimePicker` component provides an input field with assigned sliders which
   * are opened on user action. The `sap.ui.webc.main.TimePicker` allows users to select a localized time
   * using touch, mouse, or keyboard input. It consists of two parts: the time input field and the sliders.
   *
   * Usage: The user can enter a time by:
   * 	 - Using the sliders that are displayed in a popup
   * 	 - Typing it in directly in the input field
   *
   *  When the user makes an entry and chooses the enter key, the sliders shows the corresponding time. When
   * the user directly triggers the sliders display, the actual time is displayed. For the `sap.ui.webc.main.TimePicker`
   *
   * Formatting:
   *
   * If a time is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used time format.
   *
   *  Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. For more information,
   * see {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table UTS #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup
   * Language}.
   *
   *  For example, if the `format-pattern` is "HH:mm:ss", a valid value string is "11:42:35" and the same
   * is displayed in the input.
   *
   * Keyboard handling: [F4], [ALT]+[UP], [ALT]+[DOWN] Open/Close picker dialog and move focus to it.
   *  When closed:
   * 	 - [PAGEUP] - Increments hours by 1. If 12 am is reached, increment hours to 1 pm and vice versa.
   * 	 - [PAGEDOWN] - Decrements the corresponding field by 1. If 1 pm is reached, decrement hours to 12 am
   * 			and vice versa.
   * 	 - [SHIFT]+[PAGEUP] Increments minutes by 1.
   * 	 - [SHIFT]+ [PAGEDOWN] Decrements minutes by 1.
   * 	 - [SHIFT]+[CTRL]+[PAGEUP] Increments seconds by 1.
   * 	 - [SHIFT]+[CTRL]+ [PAGEDOWN] Decrements seconds by 1.  When opened:
   * 	 - [UP] If focus is on one of the selection lists: Select the value which is above the current value.
   * 			If the first value is selected, select the last value in the list. Exception: AM/ PM List: stay on the
   * 			first item.
   * 	 - [DOWN] If focus is on one of the selection lists: Select the value which is below the current value.
   * 			If the last value is selected, select the first value in the list. Exception: AM/ PM List: stay on the
   * 			last item.
   * 	 - [LEFT] If focus is on one of the selection lists: Move focus to the selection list which is left
   * 			of the current selection list. If focus is at the first selection list, move focus to the last selection
   * 			list.
   * 	 - [RIGHT] If focus is on one of the selection lists: Move focus to the selection list which is right
   * 			of the current selection list. When focus is at the last selection list, move focus to the first selection
   * 			list.
   * 	 - [PAGEUP] If focus is on one of the selection lists: Move focus to the first entry of this list.
   * 	 - [PAGEDOWN] If focus is on one of the selection lists: Move focus to the last entry of this list.

   * @SINCE 1.92.0

   *
   * Overview: The `sap.ui.webc.main.Tree` component provides a tree structure for displaying data in a hierarchy.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * When to use::
   * 	 - To display hierarchically structured items.
   * 	 - To select one or more items out of a set of hierarchically structured items.
   *
   * When not to use::
   * 	 - To display items not hierarchically strcutured. In this case, use the List component.
   * 	 - To select one item from a very small number of non-hierarchical items. Select or ComboBox might be
   * 			more appropriate.
   * 	 - The hierarchy turns out to have only two levels. In this case, use List with group items.
   *
   * Keyboard Handling:
   *
   * The `sap.ui.webc.main.Tree` provides advanced keyboard handling. The user can use the following keyboard
   * shortcuts in order to navigate trough the tree:
   * 	 - [UP/DOWN] - Navigates up and down the tree items that are currently visible.
   * 	 - [RIGHT] - Drills down the tree by expanding the tree nodes.
   * 	 - [LEFT] - Goes up the tree and collapses the tree nodes.
   *
   *
   * The user can use the following keyboard shortcuts to perform selection, when the `mode` property is in
   * use:
   * 	 - [SPACE] - Selects the currently focused item upon keyup.
   * 	 - [ENTER] - Selects the currently focused item upon keydown.

   * @EXPERIMENTAL (since 1.92.0) - This control is experimental and its API might change significantly.
   *
   * Overview: This is the item to use inside a `sap.ui.webc.main.Tree`. You can represent an arbitrary tree
   * structure by recursively nesting tree items.
   *
   * Usage: `sap.ui.webc.main.TreeItem` is an abstract element, representing a node in a `sap.ui.webc.main.Tree`.
   * The tree itself is rendered as a list, and each `sap.ui.webc.main.TreeItem` is represented by a list
   * item(`sap.ui.webc.main.TreeListItem`) in that list. Therefore, you should only use `sap.ui.webc.main.TreeItem`
   * directly in your apps. The `sap.ui.webc.main.TreeListItem` list item is internal for the list, and not
   * intended for public use.
