   * returns an object with the following fields:
   * 	`canOverflow` - A boolean that tells whether the control can move to the overflow menu or not.
   *
   * **Note:** Even if `canOverflow` is set to `false`, the `propsUnrelatedToSize` field is taken into account,
   * allowing to optimize the behavior of controls that do not need to overflow, but are used in an `sap.m.OverflowToolbar`
   * regardless.
   *
   *
   * 	 - `autoCloseEvents` - An array of strings, listing all of the control's events that should trigger
   * 			the closing of the overflow menu, when fired.
   *
   *
   * 	 - `invalidationEvents` - An array of strings, listing all of the control's events that should trigger
   * 			the invalidation of the `sap.m.OverflowToolbar`, when fired.
   *
   * `propsUnrelatedToSize` - An array of strings, listing all of the control's properties that, when
   * changed, should not cause the overflow toolbar to invalidate.
   *
   * **Note:** By default `sap.m.OverflowToolbar` invalidates whenever any property of a child control changes.
   * This is to ensure that whenever the size of a child control changes, the overflow toolbar's layout is
   * recalculated. Some properties however do not affect control size, making it unnecessary to invalidate
   * the overflow toolbar when they change. You can list them here for optimization purposes.
   *
   * `onBeforeEnterOverflow(oControl)` - A callback function that will be invoked before moving the control
   * into the overflow menu. The control instance will be passed as an argument.
   *
   * **Note:** The context of the function is not the control instance (use the `oControl` parameter for this
   * purpose), but rather an internal helper object, associated with the current `sap.m.OverflowToolbar` instance.
   * This object only needs to be manipulated in special cases (e.g. when you want to store state on it, rather
   * than on the control instance).
   *
   * `onAfterExitOverflow(oControl)` - A callback function that will be invoked after taking the control
   * out of the overflow menu (before moving it back to the toolbar itself). The control instance will be
   * passed as an argument.
   *
   * **Note:** See: `onBeforeEnterOverflow` for details about the function's context.
   *
   * `getCustomImportance()` - A function that, if provided, will be called to determine the priority
   * of the control. This function must return a value of type `sap.m.OverflowToolbarPriority`. The string
   * "Medium" is also accepted and interpreted as priority between `Low` and `High`.
   *
   * **Note:** Normally priority in `sap.m.OverflowToolbar` is managed with the `priority` property of `sap.m.OverflowToolbarLayoutData`.
   * However, some controls may have other means of defining priority, such as dedicated properties or other
   * types of layout data for that purpose. In summary, implementing this function allows a control to override
   * the default priority logic (`sap.m.OverflowToolbarLayoutData`) by providing its own.
   *
   * **Important:** In addition, the control can implement a CSS class, scoped with the `.sapMOverflowToolbarMenu-CTX`
   * context selector, that will be applied whenever the control is inside the overflow menu. For example,
   * to make your control take up the whole width of the overflow menu, you can add a context class to your
   * control's base CSS file like this:
   *
   *
   * ```javascript
   *
   *       .sapMOverflowToolbarMenu-CTX .sapMyControlClass {
   *       	width: 100%;
   *       }
   *   ```

   * URL (Uniform Resource Locator) Helper.

   * This helper can be used to trigger a native application (e.g. email, sms, phone) from the browser. That
   * means we are restricted of browser or application implementation. e.g.
   * 	 - Some browsers do not let you pass more than 2022 characters in the URL
   * 	 - MAPI (Outlook) limit is 2083, max. path under Internet Explorer is 2048
   * 	 - Different Internet Explorer versions have a different URL length limits (IE9 approximately 1000 characters)
   *
   * 	 - MS mail app under Windows 8 cuts mail links after approximately 100 characters
   * 	 - Safari gets a confirmation from user before opening a native application and can block other triggers
   * 			if the user cancels it
   * 	 - Some mail applications(Outlook) do not respect all encodings (e.g. Cyrillic texts are not encoded
   * 			correctly)
   *
   * **Note:** all the given maximum lengths are for URL encoded text (e.g a space character will be encoded
   * as "%20").
   *
   * It has been reported by some users that the content send through the `URLHelper` is not correctly displayed
   * by the native applications (e.g. a native mail application).
   *
   * After sending the body to the application, `URLHelper` cannot affect its rendering and the application
   * takes responsibility to correctly display the content. Inconsistencies between different native applications
   * or operative systems (OS) can lead to different behaviors and differences in the displayed content.
   *
   * **Example:**
   *
   * What happens with a link added to the content of an email using the `URLHelper` ?
   *
   * Apart from the correct generation of URL, everything else is outside of the scope of `URLHelper` as responsibility
   * from then on is passed to the browser and the native applications handling the URL. For instance, clicking
   * on an email link should result in triggering an action in the default mail application for the user's
   * OS and it is this application's responsibility to correctly handle the URL, given it is generated correctly.

   *
   * An image-like control that has different display options for representing images, initials, and icons.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `Avatar` control allows the usage of different content, shapes, and sizes depending on the use case.
   *
   * The content types that can be displayed are either images, icons, or initials. The shape can be circular
   * or square. There are several predefined sizes, as well as an option to set a custom size.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * Up to two Latin letters can be displayed as initials in an `Avatar`. If there are more than two letters,
   * or if there's a non-Latin character present, a default image placeholder will be created.
   *
   * There are two options for how the displayed image can fit inside the available area:
   * 	 - Cover - the image is scaled to cover all of the available area
   * 	 - Contain - the image is scaled as large as possible while both its height and width fit inside the
   * 			avalable area  **Note:** To set a custom size for the `Avatar`, you have to choose the `Custom`
   * 			value for the `displaySize` property. Then, you have to set both the `customDisplaySize` and `customFontSize`
   * 			properties.

  /**
   * Used as a header, sub-header and a footer of a page.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `Bar` control consists of three areas to hold its content. It has the capability to center content,
   * such as a title, while having other controls on the left and right side.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * With the use of the `design` property, you can set the style of the `Bar` to appear as a header, sub-header
   * and footer.
   *
   * **Note:** Do not place a `sap.m.Bar` inside another `sap.m.Bar` or inside any bar-like control. Doing
   * so causes unpredictable behavior.
   *
   * Responsive Behavior:
   *
   * The content in the middle area is centrally positioned if there is enough space. If the right or left
   * content overlaps the middle content, the middle content will be centered in the space between.

   * 	 - `title` - A title for the dialog. By default, there is no title.
   * 	 - `text` - A text displayed above the busy animation.
   * 	 - `showCancelButton` - An optional Cancel button to stop the execution.
   * 	 - `customIcon` - An optional alternative icon to use as a busy animation.  Usage: When to use:
   *
   * 	 - The operation lasts more than one second.
   * 	 - You want to indicate loading in a page-to-page navigation (lightweight version).
   * 	 - Offer a Cancel button if you expect the process to run more than 10 seconds.
   * 	 -  If you do not show a title or text, use the {@link sap.ui.core.InvisibleText invisible text} control
   * 			to provide the reason for users with assistive technologies.  When not to use:
   * 	 - The screen is not supposed to be blocked. Use a {@link sap.m.BusyIndicator} for the specific application
   * 			part.
   * 	 - Do not use the title of the busy dialog. Provide a precise text describing the operation in `text`.

  /**
   * The carousel allows the user to browse through a set of items by swiping right or left. Overview: The
   * control is mostly used for showing a gallery of images, but can hold any sap.m control. Structure: The
   * carousel consists of a the following elements:
   * 	 - Content area - displays the different items.
   * 	 - Navigation - arrows to the left and right for switching between items.
   * 	 - (optional) Paging - indicator at the bottom to show the current position in the set.  The paging
   * 			indicator can be configured as follows:
   * 	 - `showPageIndicator` - determines if the indicator is displayed.
   * 	 - If the pages are less than 9, the page indicator is represented with bullets.
   * 	 - If the pages are 9 or more, the page indicator is numeric.
   * 	 - `pageIndicatorPlacement` - determines where the indicator is located. Default (`sap.m.PlacementType.Bottom`)
   * 			- below the content.  Additionally, you can also change the location of the navigation arrows. By
   * 			setting `arrowsPlacement` to `sap.m.CarouselArrowsPlacement.PageIndicator`, the arrows will be located
   * 			at the bottom by the paging indicator. Note: When the content is of type `sap.m.Image` add "Image" text
   * 			at the end of the `"alt"` description in order to provide accessibility info for the UI element. Usage:
   * 			 When to use:
   * 	 - The items you want to display are very different from each other.
   * 	 - You want to display the items one after the other.   When not to use:
   * 	 - The items you want to display need to be visible at the same time.
   * 	 - The items you want to display are uniform and very similar  Responsive Behavior:
   * 	 - On touch devices, navigation is performed with swipe gestures (swipe right or swipe left).
   * 	 - On desktop, navigation is done with the navigation arrows.
   * 	 - The paging indicator (when activated) is visible on each form factor.

  /**
   * Allows the user to set a binary value, such as true/false or yes/no for an item.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `CheckBox` control consists of a box and a label that describes its purpose. If it's checked, an
   * indicator is displayed inside the box.
   *
   * To select/deselect the `CheckBox`, the user has to click or tap the square box or its label. Clicking
   * or tapping toggles the `CheckBox` between checked and unchecked state. The `CheckBox` control only has
   * 3 states - checked, unchecked and partially selected.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * You can set the width of the element containing the box and the label manually with the use of the `width`
   * property. If the text exceeds the available width, it is truncated.
   *
   * **Note:** When `useEntireWidth` property is set to `true`, the value of the `width` property is applied
   * to the control as a whole (box and label). If `useEntireWidth` is set to `false`, the `width` is applied
   * to the label only.
   *
   * The touchable area for toggling the `CheckBox` ends where the text ends.
   *
   * If the width allows more space than the text requires, white space is added. The text can be positioned
   * manually in this space using the `textAlign` property.
   *
   * **Note:** Keep in mind that setting the `textAlign` property to `Right` can result in a large amount
   * of white space between the box and the text.
   *
   * You can disable the `CheckBox` by setting the `enabled` property to `false`, or use the `CheckBox` in
   * read-only mode by setting the `editable` property to false.
   *
   * **Note:** Disabled and read-only states shouldn't be used together.

   *
   * You can customize them with the use of the `colors` property. You can specify a `defaultColor` and display
   * a "Default color" button for the user to choose directly. You can display a "More colors..." button that
   * opens an additional color picker for the user to choose specific colors that are not present in the predefined
   * range.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * The palette is intended for users, who don't want to check and remember the different values of the colors
   * and spend large amount of time to configure the right color through the color picker.
   *
   * The control can be embedded in a form or can be opened as popover (by use of thin wrapper control `sap.m.ColorPalettePopover`).

   *
   * A drop-down list for selecting and filtering values. Overview: The control represents a drop-down menu
   * with a list of the available options and a text input field to narrow down the options. Structure: The
   * combo-box consists of the following elements:
   * 	 -  Input field - displays the selected option or a custom user entry. Users can type to narrow down
   * 			the list or enter their own value.
   * 	 -  Drop-down arrow - expands\collapses the option list.
   * 	 -  Option list - the list of available options. **Note:** Disabled items are not visualized in the
   * 			list with the available options, however they can still be accessed through the `items` aggregation.
   * 			 By setting the `showSecondaryValues` property, the combo box can display an additional value for
   * 			each option (if there is one). **Note:** The typeahead feature is not available on Android devices due
   * 			to a OS specific issue. Usage: When to use::
   * 	 - You need to select only one item in a long list of options (between 13 and 200) or your custom user
   * 			input.  When not to use::
   * 	 - You need to select between only two options. Use a {@link sap.m.Switch switch} control instead.
   * 	 - You need to select between up to 12 options. Use a {@link sap.m.Select select} control instead.
   * 	 - You need to select between more than 200 options. Use a {@link sap.m.Input input} control with value
   * 			help instead.
   *
   * Note:: The control has the following behavior regarding the `selectedKey` and `value` properties:
   *
   * 	 -  On initial loading, if the control has a `selectedKey` set which corresponds to a matching item,
   * 			and a set `value`, the `value` will be updated to the matching item's text.
   * 	 -  If a `selectedKey` is set and the user types an input which corresponds to an item's text, the `selectedKey`
   * 			will be updated with the matching item's key.
   * 	 -  If a `selectedKey` is set and the user types an input which does not correspond to any item's text,
   * 			the `selectedKey` will be set to an empty string ("")
   * 	 -  If a `selectedKey` is set and the user selects an item, the `selectedKey` will be updated to match
   * 			the selected item's key.
   * 	 -  If a `selectedKey` is bound and the user types before the data is loaded, the user's input will
   * 			be overwritten by the binding update.
   *
   * Responsive Behavior:
   * 	 - As the `sap.m.ComboBox` control allows free text, as well as has `selectedKey` / `selectedItem` properties,
   * 			here is brief explanation of how they are updated during model change:
   * 	 - If the ComboBox has `selectedKey` and `selectedItem` set, the model changes and the item key is no
   * 			longer amongst the newly added items, the value of the ComboBox will remain the same and the `selectedKey`
   * 			and `selectedItem` properties **will not** be changed.
   * 	 - If the ComboBox has `selectedKey` and `selectedItem` set, the model changes and the item key corresponds
   * 			to newly added item, with different text, the value of the ComboBox **will** be updated with the text
   * 			of the newly corresponding item.
   * 	 - If the ComboBox has only value, but no `selectedKey` and `selectedItem` set, the model changes, the
   * 			value **will** remain the same and the `selectedKey` and `selectedItem` properties **will not** be changed.
   *
   * 	 - The width of the option list adapts to its content. The minimum width is the input field plus the
   * 			drop-down arrow.
   * 	 - There is no horizontal scrolling in the option list. Entries in the list that are too long will be
   * 			truncated.
   * 	 - On phone devices the combo box option list opens a dialog.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.22.0
   *
   * Enables the users to select a localized date between 0001-01-01 and 9999-12-31.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `DatePicker` lets the users select a localized date using touch, mouse, or keyboard input. It consists
   * of two parts: the date input field and the date picker.
   *
   * **Note:** The {@link sap.ui.unified.Calendar} is used internally only if the `DatePicker` is opened (not
   * used for the initial rendering). If the `sap.ui.unified` library is not loaded before the `DatePicker`
   * is opened, it will be loaded upon opening. This could lead to a waiting time when the `DatePicker` is
   * opened for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the `DatePicker` should also load the `sap.ui.unified`
   * library.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * The user can enter a date by:
   * 	 - Using the calendar that opens in a popup
   * 	 - Typing it in directly in the input field
   *
   * On app level, there are two options to provide a date for the `DatePicker` - as a string to the `value`
   * property or as a JavaScript Date object to the `dateValue` property (only one of these properties should
   * be used at a time):
   *
   *
   * 	 - Use the `value` property if you want to bind the `DatePicker` to a model using the `sap.ui.model.type.Date`
   *
   * 	 - Use the `value` property if the date is provided as a string from the backend or inside the app (for
   * 			example, as ABAP type DATS field)
   * 	 - Use the `dateValue` property if the date is already provided as a JavaScript Date object or you want
   * 			to work with a JavaScript Date object. Use `dateValue` as a helper property to easily obtain the day,
   * 			month and year of the chosen date. Although possible to bind it, the recommendation is not to do it.
   * 			When binding is needed, use `value` property instead
   *
   * Formatting:
   *
   * All formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}.
   * If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.
   *
   * Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}
   *
   * For example, if the `valueFormat` is "yyyy-MM-dd", the `displayFormat` is "MMM d, y", and the used locale
   * is English, a valid value string is "2015-07-30", which leads to an output of "Jul 30, 2015".
   *
   * If no placeholder is set to the `DatePicker`, the used `displayFormat` is displayed as a placeholder.
   * If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.
   *
   * **Note:** If the string does NOT match the `displayFormat` (from user input) or the `valueFormat` (on
   * app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale
   * settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * The `DatePicker` is smaller in compact mode and provides a touch-friendly size in cozy mode.
   *
   * On mobile devices, one tap on the input field opens the `DatePicker` in full screen. To close the window,
   * the user can select a date (which triggers the close event), or select Cancel.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.22.0
   *
   * A single-field input control that enables the users to enter a localized date range (between 0001-01-01
   * and 9999-12-31).
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `DateRangeSelection` enables the users to enter a localized date range using touch, mouse, keyboard
   * input, or by selecting a date range in the calendar. They can also navigate directly from one month or
   * year to another.
   *
   * **Note:** The control is not UTC aware and the selected date range starts from 00:00:00:000 of the first
   * date and ends in 23:59:59:999 on the second date.
   *
   * The {@link sap.ui.unified.Calendar} is used internally only if the `DateRangeSelection` is opened (not
   * used for the initial rendering). If the `sap.ui.unified` library is not loaded before the `DateRangeSelection`
   * is opened, it will be loaded upon opening. This could lead to a waiting time when the `DateRangeSelection`
   * is opened for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the `DateRangeSelection` should also load the
   * `sap.ui.unified` library.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * When to use?
   *
   * If you need a date range and know that your user is a power user who has to input lots of data. If the
   * keyboard is the primary device used for navigating the app, use two input fields. This allows the user
   * to quickly jump from field to field. By selecting a date in one of the fields, the other field should
   * recognize the information and jump to the same selection.
   *
   * When not to use?
   *
   * If the user's primary goal is not to select ranges or if you just want to enter a date and a time. For
   * such cases, use the {@link sap.m.DatePicker} or {@link sap.m.TimePicker}.
   *
   * The user can enter a date by:
   * 	 - Using the calendar that opens in a popup
   * 	 - Typing it in directly in the input field
   *
   * On app level, there are two options to provide a date for the `DateRangeSelection` - date range as a
   * string to the `value` property or JavaScript Date objects to the `dateValue` and `secondDateValue` properties
   * (only one of these options should be used at a time):
   *
   *
   * 	 - Use the `value` property if the date range is already provided as a formatted string
   * 	 - Use the `dateValue` and `secondDateValue` properties if the date range is already provided as JavaScript
   * 			Date objects or you want to work with JavaScript Date objects
   *
   * Formatting:
   *
   * All formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}.
   * If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.
   *
   * Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}
   *
   * For example, if the `displayFormat` is "MMM d, y", delimiter is "-", and the used locale is English,
   * a valid value string is "Jul 29, 2015 - Jul 31, 2015" and it is displayed in the same way in the input
   * field.
   *
   * If no placeholder is set to the `DateRangeSelection`, the used `displayFormat` is displayed as a placeholder.
   * If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.
   *
   * **Note:** If the string does NOT match the `displayFormat` (from user input) or the `valueFormat` (on
   * app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale
   * settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * The `DateRangeSelection` is fully responsive. It is smaller in compact mode and provides a touch-friendly
   * size in cozy mode.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.38.0
   *
   * Enables the users to select date (between 0001-01-01 and 9999-12-31) and time values in a combined input.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `DateTimePicker` control consists of two parts: the input field and the date/time picker.
   *
   * **Note:** The {@link sap.ui.unified.Calendar} is used internally only if the `DateTimePicker` is opened
   * (not used for the initial rendering). If the `sap.ui.unified` library is not loaded before the `DateTimePicker`
   * is opened, it will be loaded upon opening. This could lead to a waiting time when the `DateTimePicker`
   * is opened for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the `DateTimePicker` should also load the `sap.ui.unified`
   * library.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * Use this control if you need a combined date and time input control.
   *
   * Don't use it if you want to use either a date or a time value. In this case, use the {@link sap.m.DatePicker}
   * or the {@link sap.m.TimePicker} controls instead.
   *
   * The user can enter a date by:
   * 	 - Using the calendar or a time selector that opens in a popup
   * 	 - Typing it in directly in the input field
   *
   * On app level, there are two options to provide a date for the `DateTimePicker` - as a string to the `value`
   * property or as a JavaScript Date object to the `dateValue` property (only one of these properties should
   * be used at a time):
   *
   *
   * 	 - Use the `value` property if you want to bind the `DateTimePicker` to a model using the `sap.ui.model.type.DateTime`
   *
   * 	 - Use the `value` property if the date is provided as a string from the backend or inside the app (for
   * 			example, as ABAP type DATS field)
   * 	 - Use the `dateValue` property if the date is already provided as a JavaScript Date object or you want
   * 			to work with a JavaScript Date object. Use `dateValue` as a helper property to easily obtain the day,
   * 			month, year, hours, minutes and seconds of the chosen date and time. Although possible to bind it, the
   * 			recommendation is not to do it. When binding is needed, use `value` property instead
   *
   * Formatting:
   *
   * All formatting and parsing of dates from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}.
   * If a date is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used date format and locale.
   *
   * Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}
   *
   * For example, if the `valueFormat` is "yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss", the `displayFormat` is "MMM d, y, HH:mm:ss",
   * and the used locale is English, a valid value string is "2015-07-30-10-30-15", which leads to an output
   * of "Jul 30, 2015, 10:30:15".
   *
   * If no placeholder is set to the `DateTimePicker`, the used `displayFormat` is displayed as a placeholder.
   * If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.
   *
   * **Note:** If the string does NOT match the `displayFormat` (from user input) or the `valueFormat` (on
   * app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale
   * settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * The `DateTimePicker` is responsive and fully adapts to all devices. For larger screens, such as tablet
   * or desktop, it opens as a popover. For mobile devices, it opens in full screen.

  /**
   * A popup that interrupts the current processing and prompts the user for an action or an input in a modal
   * mode. Overview: The Dialog control is used to prompt the user for an action or a confirmation. It interrupts
   * the current app processing as it is the only focused UI element and the main screen is dimmed/blocked.
   * The content of the Dialog is fully customizable. Structure: A Dialog consists of a title, optional subtitle,
   * content area and a footer for action buttons. The Dialog is usually displayed at the center of the screen.
   * Its size and position can be changed by the user. To enable this, you need to set the properties `resizable`
   * and `draggable` accordingly. In that case the dialog title bar can be focused. While the keyboard focus
   * is located on the title bar, the dialog can be moved with the arrow keys and resized with shift+arrow
   * keys.
   *
   * There are other specialized types of dialogs:
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.P13nDialog Personalization Dialog} - used for personalizing sorting, filtering and grouping
   * 			in tables
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.SelectDialog Select Dialog} - used to select one or more items from a comprehensive
   * 			list
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.TableSelectDialog Table Select Dialog} - used to make a selection from a comprehensive
   * 			table containing multiple attributes or values
   * 	 - {@link sap.ui.comp.valuehelpdialog.ValueHelpDialog Value Help Dialog} - used to help the user find
   * 			and select single and multiple values
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.ViewSettingsDialog View Settings Dialog} - used to sort, filter, or group data within
   * 			a (master) list or a table
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.BusyDialog Busy Dialog} - used to block the screen and inform the user about an ongoing
   * 			operation  Usage: When to use::
   * 	 - You want to display a system message.
   * 	 - You want to interrupt the user’s action.
   * 	 - You want to show a message with a short and a long description.  When not to use::
   * 	 - You just want to confirm a successful action.  Responsive Behavior:
   * 	 - If the `stretch` property is set to `true`, the Dialog displays on full screen.
   * 	 - If the `contentWidth` and/or `contentHeight` properties are set, the Dialog will try to fill those
   * 			sizes.
   * 	 - If there is no specific sizing, the Dialog will try to adjust its size to its content.  When
   * 			using the `sap.m.Dialog` in SAP Quartz themes, the breakpoints and layout paddings could be determined
   * 			by the Dialog's width. To enable this concept and add responsive paddings to an element of the Dialog
   * 			control, you have to add the following classes depending on your use case: `sapUiResponsivePadding--header`,
   * 			`sapUiResponsivePadding--subHeader`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--content`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--footer`.
   * 			Smartphones: If the Dialog has one or two actions, they will cover the entire footer. If there are more
   * 			actions, they will overflow. Tablets: The action buttons in the toolbar are **right-aligned**. Use **cozy**
   * 			mode on tablet devices. Desktop: The action buttons in the toolbar are **right-aligned**. Use **compact**
   * 			mode on desktop.

   * Overview:
   *
   * The dynamic date range is a control that offers a choice of absolute and relative dates, using different
   * offset from the current date. The list of values offered must be defined by the application.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * The control usage is recommended when:
   * 	 - Flexibility of choosing from absolute or relative dates and date ranges.
   * 	 - The relative representation of a date should be reused. (For example, show values from today regardless
   * 			of when you open the application)
   *
   * The `DynamicDateRange` control supports a number of standard options: see {@link sap.m.StandardDynamicDateRangeKeys}.
   * A custom option could be defined by using the `sap.m.CustomDynamicDateOption` class and appending an
   * instance of this class into the `sap.m.DynamicDateUtil` options. In order for a specific option to be
   * used its key should be added into the `options` property of the control. No options are added by default.
   *
   * Suggestions are available when the user types in the control input field.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * On mobile devices, when user taps on the `DynamicDateRange` input icon a full screen dialog is opened.
   * The dialog is closed via a date time period value selection or by pressing the "Cancel" button.

  /**
   * Provides filtering functionality with multiple parameters.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `FacetFilter` control is used to provide filtering functionality with multiple parameters and supports
   * the users in finding the information they need from potentially very large data sets.
   *
   * Your app can have dependencies between facets where selection of filter items in one facet list limits
   * the list of valid filters in another facet list.
   *
   * The `FacetFilter` uses {@link sap.m.FacetFilterList FacetFilterList} and {@link sap.m.FacetFilterItem
   * FacetFilterItem} to model facets and their associated filters.
   *
   * **Note: **{@link sap.m.FacetFilterList FacetFilterList} is a subclass of {@link sap.m.List} and supports
   * growing enablement feature via the property `growing`. When you use this feature, be aware that it only
   * works with one-way data binding. Having growing feature enabled when the `items` aggregation is bound
   * to a model with two-way data binding, may lead to unexpected and/or inconsistent behavior across browsers,
   * such as unexpected closing of the list.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * Use the `FacetFilter` if your app displays a large list of items that can be grouped by multiple parameters,
   * for example products by category and supplier. With the `FacetFilter`, you allow the users to dynamically
   * filter the list so it only displays products from the categories and suppliers they want to see.
   *
   * While the {@link sap.m.FacetFilterList} popup is opened (when the user selects a button corresponding
   * to the list's name), any other activities leading to focus change will close it. For example, when the
   * popup is opened and the app developer loads a {@link sap.m.BusyDialog} or any other dialog that obtains
   * the focus, the popup will be closed.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * The `FacetFilter` supports the following two types, which can be configured using the control's `type`
   * property:
   *
   *
   * 	 - Simple type (default) - only available for desktop and tablet screen sizes. The active facets are
   * 			displayed as individually selectable buttons on the toolbar.
   * 	 - Light type - automatically enabled on smart phone sized devices, but also available for desktop and
   * 			tablets. The active facets and selected filter items are displayed in the summary bar. When the user
   * 			selects the summary bar, a navigable dialog list of all facets is displayed. When the user selects a
   * 			facet, the dialog scrolls to show the list of filters that are available for the selected facet.
   *
   * Additional Information:
   *
   * For more information, go to **Developer Guide** section in the Demo Kit and navigate to **More About
   * Controls** > **sap.m** > **Facet Filter**

  /**
   * The IconTabBar represents a collection of tabs with associated content. Overview: The IconTabBar can
   * be used for navigation within an object, or as a filter. Different types of IconTabBar are used based
   * on the contents.
   * 	 - Filter - There is only one main content for all tabs. The main content can be filtered, based on
   * 			the selected tab.
   * 	 - Normal tab bar - The contents of each tab are independent from each other.
   * 	 - Combination of the above - There can be both filtered and independent contents.  Structure:
   * 			The IconTabBar can hold two types of entities {@link sap.m.IconTabFilter sap.m.IconTabFilter} and {@link
   * 			sap.m.IconTabSeparator sap.m.IconTabSeparator}
   *
   * The IconTabFilter holds all information on an item - text, icon and count.
   *
   * The IconTabSeparator holds an icon that can be used to show a process that runs from item to item. Usage:
   * Text only: Uses text labels as tabs with optional counter
   * 	 - Used when there are no suitable icons for all items.
   * 	 - Used when longer labels are needed.
   * 	 - If `headerMode` property is set to `Inline` the text and the count are displayed in one line.
   * 	 - `UpperCase` is disabled.
   * 	 - Use title case.  Icon Tabs: Round tabs with optional counter and label
   * 	 - Used when there are unique icons for all items.
   * 	 - Only shorter labels are possible.
   * 	 - Provide labels for all icons or for none. Do not mix these.  Tabs as filters: Tabs with filtered
   * 			content from the same set of items
   * 	 - Provide an "All" tab to show all items without filtering.
   * 	 - Use counters to show the number of items in each filter.  Tabs as process steps: Tabs show a
   * 			single step in a process
   * 	 - Use an arrow (e.g. triple-chevron) as a separator to connect the steps.
   * 	 - Use counters to show the number of items in each filter.  Hierarchies: Multiple sub tabs could
   * 			be placed underneath one main tab. Nesting allows deeper hierarchies with indentations to indicate the
   * 			level of each nested tab. When a tab has both sub tabs and own content its click area is split to allow
   * 			the user to display the content or alternatively to expand/collapse the list of sub tabs. Responsive
   * 			Behavior:
   * 	 - Text-only tabs are never truncated.
   * 	 - Use the `expandable` property to specify whether users can collapse the tab container (default =
   * 			true).
   * 	 - On desktop, tabs can be dragged and dropped (property `enableTabReordering`).
   * 	 - If you have a large number of tabs, only the tabs that can fit on screen will be visible. All other
   * 			tabs that can't fit on the screen are available in an overflow tab "More".  When using the `sap.m.IconTabBar`
   * 			in SAP Quartz themes, the breakpoints and layout paddings could be determined by the Icon Tab Bar's width.
   * 			To enable this concept and add responsive paddings to an element of the Icon Tab Bar control, you have
   * 			to add the following classes depending on your use case: `sapUiResponsivePadding--header`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--content`.

  /**
   * Allows the user to enter and edit text or numeric values in one line.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * You can enable the autocomplete suggestion feature and the value help option to easily enter a valid
   * value.
   *
   * Guidelines:
   *
   *
   * 	 -  Always provide a meaningful label for any input field
   * 	 -  Limit the length of the input field. This will visually emphasize the constraints for the field.
   *
   * 	 -  Do not use the `placeholder` property as a label.
   * 	 -  Use the `description` property only for small fields with no placeholders (i.e. for currencies).
   *
   *
   * Structure:
   *
   * The controls inherits from {@link sap.m.InputBase} which controls the core properties like:
   * 	 -  editable / read-only
   * 	 -  enabled / disabled
   * 	 -  placeholder
   * 	 -  text direction
   * 	 -  value states  To aid the user during input, you can enable value help (`showValueHelp`) or
   * 			autocomplete (`showSuggestion`). **Value help** will open a new dialog where you can refine your input.
   * 			**Autocomplete** has three types of suggestions:
   * 	 -  Single value - a list of suggestions of type `sap.ui.core.Item` or `sap.ui.core.ListItem`
   * 	 -  Two values - a list of two suggestions (ID and description) of type `sap.ui.core.Item` or `sap.ui.core.ListItem`
   *
   * 	 -  Tabular suggestions of type `sap.m.ColumnListItem`   The suggestions are stored in two aggregations
   * 			`suggestionItems` (for single and double values) and `suggestionRows` (for tabular values).
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * **When to use:** Use the control for short inputs like emails, phones, passwords, fields for assisted
   * value selection.
   *
   * **When not to use:** Don't use the control for long texts, dates, designated search fields, fields for
   * multiple selection.
   *
   * Known Restrictions:
   *
   * If `showValueHelp` or if `showSuggestion` is `true`, the native browser autofill will not fire a change
   * event.
   *
   * Note:: The control has the following behavior regarding the `selectedKey` and `value` properties:
   *
   * 	 -  On initial loading, if the control has a `selectedKey` set which corresponds to a matching item,
   * 			and a set `value`, the `value` will be updated to the matching item's text.
   * 	 -  If a `selectedKey` is set and the user types an input which corresponds to an item's text, the `selectedKey`
   * 			will be updated with the matching item's key.
   * 	 -  If a `selectedKey` is set and the user types an input which does not correspond to any item's text,
   * 			the `selectedKey` will be set to an empty string ("")
   * 	 -  If a `selectedKey` is set and the user selects an item, the `selectedKey` will be updated to match
   * 			the selected item's key.
   * 	 -  If a `selectedKey` is bound and the user types before the data is loaded, the user's input will
   * 			be overwritten by the binding update.

   * Overview: Labels are used as titles for single controls or groups of controls. Labels for required fields
   * are marked with an asterisk.
   *
   * Label appearance can be influenced by properties, such as `textAlign`, `design`, `displayOnly`, `wrapping`
   * and `wrappingType`.
   *
   * As of version 1.50, the default value of the `wrapping` property is set to `false`.
   *
   * As of version 1.60, you can hyphenate the label's text with the use of the `wrappingType` property. For
   * more information, see {@link topic:6322164936f047de941ec522b95d7b70 Text Controls Hyphenation}.
   *
   * Usage: When to use:
   * 	 - It's recommended to use the `Label` in Form controls.
   * 	 - Use title case for labels.  When not to use:
   * 	 -  It is not recommended to use labels in Bold.

  /**
   * Represents a popup containing an image and a footer.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The purpose of the control is to display an image in its original size as long as this is possible. On
   * smaller screens images are scaled down to fit.
   *
   * **Notes:**
   * 	 - If the image doesn't load in 10 seconds, an error is displayed.
   * 	 - Setting the `imageContent` aggregation of the control as well as the source of the image and the
   * 			title of the image is mandatory. If the image source is not set, the control will not open.
   * 			Structure:
   *
   * Each LightBox holds a {@link sap.m.LightBoxItem LightBoxItem} which keeps the properties of the image:
   *
   * 	 -  imageSrc - The source URI of the image
   * 	 -  title - The title of the image
   * 	 -  subtitle - The subtitle of the image
   * 	 -  alt - The alt text of the image   Usage:
   *
   * The most common use case is to click on an image thumbnail to view it in bigger size. When the image
   * that should be displayed in the control cannot be loaded, an error is displayed in the popup.
   *
   * Responsive Behavior:
   *
   * On a mobile device, flipping the device to landscape will flip the lightbox and the image will be adjusted
   * to fit the new dimensions.
   *
   * Additional Information:
   *
   * Check out the API Reference.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.21.2
   *
   * Provides easier methods to create sap.m.Dialog with type sap.m.DialogType.Message, such as standard alerts,
   * confirmation dialogs, or arbitrary message dialogs.
   *
   * Because the `MessageBox` is a static class, a `sap.ui.require("sap/m/MessageBox");` statement must be
   * explicitly executed prior using the class. MessageBox provides several functions:
   * 	 - `show()` - This is the generic way to open a message dialog. You can customize its contents through
   * 			the `mOptions` parameter described below.
   * 	 - `alert()`, `confirm()`, `error()`, `information()`, `success()` and `warning()` - predefined templates
   * 			of message dialogs. Each value type is coming with action buttons and an icon that are corresponding
   * 			to its semantic. Although the full set of `mOptions` (applicable to `show()`) are available to them,
   * 			it is recommended to only use the documented options.
   *
   * **NOTE:** All options of show() are available for the other template functions as well, but it is recommended
   * to use show() only in more specific scenarios. **NOTE:** Due to the static nature of the `MessageBox`
   * class, you cannot expect data binding support from its helper functions. If this is required you can
   * use the `sap.m.Dialog` instead. **NOTE:** When using the `MessageBox.Error` method, there is no
   * emphasized action by design.
   *
   * Example:
   * ```javascript
   *
   * 	sap.ui.define(["sap/m/MessageBox"], function (MessageBox) {
   * 		MessageBox.show(
   * 			"This message should appear in the message box.", {
   * 				icon: MessageBox.Icon.INFORMATION,
   * 				title: "My message box title",
   * 				actions: [MessageBox.Action.YES, MessageBox.Action.NO],
   * 				emphasizedAction: MessageBox.Action.YES,
   * 				onClose: function (oAction) { / * do something * / }
   * 			}
   * 		);
   * 	});
   * ```
   *
   *
   * When using the `sap.m.MessageBox` in SAP Quartz themes, the breakpoints and layout paddings could be
   * determined by the MessageBox' width. To enable this concept and add responsive paddings to an element
   * of the MessageBox control, you have to add the following classes depending on your use case: `sapUiResponsivePadding--header`,
   * `sapUiResponsivePadding--content`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--footer`.
   * See:
   * 	{@link fiori:https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/message-box/ Message Box}

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.28
   *
   * A `MessagePopover` is used to display a summarized list of different types of messages (error, warning,
   * success, and information messages).
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * It provides a handy and systematized way to navigate and explore details for every message. It is adaptive
   * and responsive. It renders as a dialog with a Close button in the header on phones, and as a popover
   * on tablets and higher resolution devices. It also exposes an event {@link sap.m.MessagePopover#event:activeTitlePress},
   * which can be used for navigation from a message to the source of the issue. Notes::
   * 	 -  If your application changes its model between two interactions with the `MessagePopover`, this could
   * 			lead to outdated messages being shown. To avoid this, you need to call `navigateBack` when the model
   * 			is updated.
   * 	 -  Messages can have descriptions preformatted with HTML markup. In this case, the `markupDescription`
   * 			has to be set to `true`.
   * 	 -  If the message cannot be fully displayed or includes a long description, the `MessagePopover` provides
   * 			navigation to the detailed description.  Structure: The `MessagePopover` stores all messages in
   * 			an aggregation of type {@link sap.m.MessageItem} named `items`.
   *
   * A set of properties determines how the items are rendered:
   * 	 -  counter - An integer that is used to indicate the number of errors for each type.
   * 	 -  type - The type of message.
   * 	 -  title/subtitle - The title and subtitle of the message.
   * 	 -  description - The long text description of the message.
   * 	 -  activeTitle - Determines whether the title of the item is interactive.  Usage: When to use::
   *
   * 	 - When you want to make sure that all content is visible on any device.
   * 	 - When you want a way to centrally manage messages and show them to the user without additional work
   * 			for the developer. The `MessagePopover` is triggered from a messaging button in the footer toolbar. If
   * 			an error has occurred at any validation point, the total number of messages should be incremented, but
   * 			the user's work shouldn't be interrupted. Navigation between the message item and the source of the error
   * 			can be created, if needed by the application. This can be done by setting the `activeTitle` property
   * 			to `true` and providing a handler for the `activeTitlePress` event. In addition, you can achieve the
   * 			same functionality inside a different container using the {@link sap.m.MessageView} control.  Responsive
   * 			Behavior: On mobile phones, the `MessagePopover` is automatically shown in full screen mode.
   *  On desktop and tablet, the message popover opens in a popover.
   *  On desktop the opened popover is resizable, if it is placed in a {@link sap.m.Toolbar}, {@link sap.m.Bar},
   * or used in {@link sap.m.semantic.SemanticPage}.

   *
   * MessageStrip is a control that enables the embedding of application-related messages in the application.
   * Overview: The message strip displays 4 types of messages, each with a corresponding semantic color and
   * icon: Information, Success, Warning and Error.
   *
   * Each message can have a close button, so that it can be removed from the UI if needed.
   *
   * You can use a limited set of formatting tags for the message text by setting `enableFormattedText`. The
   * allowed tags are: With version 1.50
   * 	 - <a>
   * 	 - <em>
   * 	 - <strong>
   * 	 - <u>  With version 1.85
   * 	 - <br>
   *
   * Dynamically generated Message Strip: To meet the accessibility requirements when using dynamically generated
   * Message Strip you must implement it alongside `sap.ui.core.InvisibleMessage`. This will allow screen
   * readers to announce it in real time. We suggest such dynamically generated message strips to be announced
   * as Information Bar, as shown in our “Dynamic Message Strip Generator sample.”
   *
   * Usage: When to use:
   * 	 - You want to provide information or status update within the detail area of an object  When not
   * 			to use:
   * 	 - You want to display information within the object page header, within a control, in the master list,
   * 			or above the page header.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.9.2
   *
   * A small, non-disruptive popup for messages. Overview: A message toast is a small, non-disruptive popup
   * for success or information messages that disappears automatically after a few seconds. Toasts automatically
   * disappear after a timeout unless the user moves the mouse over the toast or taps on it. Notes::
   *
   * 	 - If the configured message contains HTML code or script tags, those will be escaped.
   * 	 - Line breaks (\r\n, \n\r, \r, \n) will be visualized.
   * 	 - Only one message toast can be shown at a time in the same place.  Example:: Here is an example
   * 			of a MessageToast with all default options:
   * ```javascript
   *
   * sap.m.MessageToast.show("This message should appear in the message toast", {
   *     duration: 3000,                  // default
   *     width: "15em",                   // default
   *     my: "center bottom",             // default
   *     at: "center bottom",             // default
   *     of: window,                      // default
   *     offset: "0 0",                   // default
   *     collision: "fit fit",            // default
   *     onClose: null,                   // default
   *     autoClose: true,                 // default
   *     animationTimingFunction: "ease", // default
   *     animationDuration: 1000,         // default
   *     closeOnBrowserNavigation: true   // default
   * });
   * ```
   *  Usage: When to use::
   * 	 - You want to display a short success of information message.
   * 	 - You do not want to interrupt users while they are performing an action.
   * 	 - You want to confirm a successful action.  When not to use::
   * 	 - You want to display an error or warning message.
   * 	 - You want to interrupt users while they are performing an action.
   * 	 - You want to make sure that users read the message before they leave the page.
   * 	 - You want users to be able to copy some part of the message text. (In this case, show a success {@link
   * 			sap.m.Dialog Message Dialog}.)  Responsive Behavior: The message toast has the same behavior on
   * 			all devices. However, you can adjust the width of the control, for example, for use on a desktop device.

   *
   * Overview: It is meant to be embedded into container controls (such as {@link sap.m.Popover}, {@link sap.m.ResponsivePopover},
   * {@link sap.m.Dialog}). It provides a handy and systematized way to navigate and explore details for every
   * message. If the `MessageView` contains only one item, which has either description, markupDescription
   * or longTextUrl, its details page will be displayed initially. It also exposes the {@link sap.m.MessageView#event:activeTitlePress}
   * event, which can be used for navigation from a message to its source. Notes::
   * 	 - If your application changes its model between two interactions with the `MessageView`, this could
   * 			lead to outdated messages being shown. To avoid this, you need to call `navigateBack` on the `MessageView`
   * 			BEFORE opening its container.
   * 	 -  Messages can have descriptions preformatted with HTML markup. In this case, the `markupDescription`
   * 			has to be set to `true`.
   * 	 -  If the message cannot be fully displayed, or includes a long description, the `MessageView` provides
   * 			navigation to the detailed description.   Structure: The `MessageView` stores all messages in an
   * 			association of type {@link sap.m.MessageItem}, named `items`.
   *  A set of properties determines how the items are rendered:
   * 	 -  counter - An integer that is used to indicate the number of errors for each type.
   * 	 -  type - The type of message.
   * 	 -  title/subtitle - The title and subtitle of the message.
   * 	 -  description - The long text description of the message.
   * 	 -  activeTitle - Determines whether the title of the item is interactive.  Usage: When to use::
   *
   * 	 - When you want a way to centrally manage messages and show them to the user without additional work
   * 			for the developer. If needed the navigation between the message item and the source of the error can
   * 			be created by the application. This can be done by setting the `activeTitle` property to true and providing
   * 			a handler for the `activeTitlePress` event.  Responsive Behavior: The responsiveness of the `MessageView`
   * 			is determined by the container in which it is embedded. For that reason the control could not be visualized
   * 			if the container’s sizes are not defined.

   * list have checkboxes that permit multi-selection. Entered values are displayed as {@link sap.m.Token
   * tokens}.
   *
   * When an invalid character is typed into the text field of the MultiComboBox control, the value state
   * is changed to `sap.ui.core.ValueState.Error` only for a second, as the invalid value is immediately deleted
   * from the input field. Structure: The MultiComboBox consists of the following elements:
   * 	 -  Input field - displays the selected option/s as token/s. Users can type to filter the list.
   * 			Drop-down arrow - expands\collapses the option list.
   * 	 -  Option list - the list of available options. **Note:** Disabled items are not visualized in the
   * 			list with the available options, however they can still be accessed through the `items` aggregation.
   * 			 Usage: When to use::
   * 	 - The user needs to select one or more options from a long list of options (maximum of approximately
   * 			200).  When not to use::
   * 	 - The user needs to choose between two options such as ON or OFF and YES or NO. In this case, consider
   * 			using a {@link sap.m.Switch switch} control instead
   * 	 - You need to display more that one attribute. In this case, consider using the {@link sap.m.SelectDialog
   * 			select dialog} or value help dialog instead.
   * 	 - The user needs to search on multiple attributes. In this case, consider using the {@link sap.m.SelectDialog
   * 			select dialog} or value help dialog instead.
   * 	 - Your use case requires all available options to be displayed right away, without any user interaction.
   * 			In this case, consider using the {@link sap.m.CheckBox checkboxes} instead.  Responsive Behavior:
   * 			If there are many tokens, the control shows only the last selected tokens that fit and for the others
   * 			a label N-more is provided. In case the length of the last selected token is exceeding the width of the
   * 			control, only a label N-Items is shown. In both cases, pressing on the label will show the tokens in
   * 			a popup. On Phones:
   * 	 - A new full-screen dialog opens where all items from the option list are shown.
   * 	 - You can select and deselect items from the option list.
   * 	 - With the help of a toggle button you can switch between showing all tokens and only selected ones.
   *
   * 	 - You can filter the option list by entering a value in the input.  On Tablets:
   * 	 - The auto-complete suggestions appear below or above the input field.
   * 	 - You can review the tokens by swiping them to left or right.  On Desktop:
   * 	 - The auto-complete suggestions appear below or above the input field.
   * 	 - You can review the tokens by pressing the right or left arrows on the keyboard.
   * 	 - You can select single tokens or a range of tokens and you can copy/cut/delete them.

   * **Notes:**
   * 	 -  New valid tokens are created, when the user presses Enter, selects a value from the suggestions

   * 			of the control is bound, no matter if the binding mode is set to "TwoWay". This is left to the application
   * 			logic (check the corresponding sample).
   * 	 -  When multiple values are copied and pasted in the field, separate tokens are created for each of
   * 			them.
   * 	 -  When a single value is copied and pasted in the field, it is shown as a text value, as further editing
   * 			might be required before it is converted into a token.
   * 	 -  Provide meaningful labels for all input fields. Do not use the placeholder as a replacement for
   * 			the label.
   * 	 -  The `showValueHelp` property is overwritten and after initialization of the control, its value becomes
   * 			`truthy`.  Usage: When to use::
   * 	 -  You need to provide the value help option to help users select or search multiple business objects.
   *
   * 	 -  The dataset to choose from is expected to increase over time (for example, to more than 200 values).

     * to ensure this.
     *
     * "to" and "back" are the transition functions for the forward and backward navigation. Both will be called
     * with the following parameters: - oFromPage: the Control which is currently being displayed by the NavContainer
     * - oToPage: the Control which should be displayed by the NavContainer after the transition - fCallback:
     * a function which MUST be called when the transition has completed - oTransitionParameters: a data object
     * that can be given by application code when triggering the transition by calling to() or back(); this
     * object could give additional information to the transition function, like the DOM element which triggered
     * the transition or the desired transition duration
     *
     * The contract for "to" and "back" is that they may do an animation of their choice, but it should not
     * take "too long". At the beginning of the transition the target page "oToPage" does have the CSS class
     * "sapMNavItemHidden" which initially hides the target page (visibility:hidden). The transition can do
     * any preparation (e.g. move that page out of the screen or make it transparent) and then should remove
     * this CSS class. After the animation the target page "oToPage" should cover the entire screen and the
     * source page "oFromPage" should not be visible anymore. This page should then have the CSS class "sapMNavItemHidden".
     * For adding/removing this or other CSS classes, the transition can use the addStyleClass/removeStyleClass
     * method: oFromPage.addStyleClass("sapMNavItemHidden"); When the transition is complete, it MUST call the
     * given fCallback method to inform the NavContainer that navigation has finished!
     *
     * Hint: if the target page of your transition stays black on iPhone, try wrapping the animation start into
     * a setTimeout(..., 0) block (delayed, but without waiting).
     *
     * This method can be called on any NavContainer instance or statically on the sap.m.NavContainer type.
     * However, the transition will always be registered for the type (and ALL instances), not for the single
     * instance on which this method was invoked.
     *
     * Returns the sap.m.NavContainer type if called statically, or "this" (to allow method chaining) if called

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.28
   *
   * A container control based on {@link sap.m.Toolbar}, that provides overflow when its content does not
   * fit in the visible area.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The content of the `OverflowToolbar` moves into the overflow area from right to left when the available
   * space is not enough in the visible area of the container. It can be accessed by the user through the
   * overflow button that opens it in a popover.
   *
   * **Note:** It is recommended that you use `OverflowToolbar` over {@link sap.m.Toolbar}, unless you want
   * to avoid overflow in favor of shrinking.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * Different behavior and priorities can be set for each control inside the `OverflowToolbar`, such as certain
   * controls to appear only in the overflow area or to never move there. For more information, see {@link
   * sap.m.OverflowToolbarLayoutData} and {@link sap.m.OverflowToolbarPriority}.
   *
   * Overflow Behavior: By default, only the following controls can move to the overflow area:
   *
   *
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.Button}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.CheckBox}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.ComboBox}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.DatePicker}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.DateTimeInput}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.DateTimePicker}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.GenericTag}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.Input}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.Label}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.MenuButton}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.OverflowToolbarButton}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.OverflowToolbarToggleButton}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.SearchField}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.SegmentedButton}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.Select}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.TimePicker}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.ToggleButton}
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.ToolbarSeparator}
   * 	 - {@link sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartField}
   * 	 - {@link sap.ui.comp.smartfield.SmartLabel}
   *
   * Additionally, any control that implements the {@link sap.m.IOverflowToolbarContent} interface may define
   * its behavior (most importantly overflow behavior) when placed inside `OverflowToolbar`.
   *
   * **Note:** The `OverflowToolbar` is an adaptive container that checks the available width and hides the
   * part of its content that doesn't fit. It is intended that simple controls, such as {@link sap.m.Button}
   * and {@link sap.m.Label} are used as content. Embedding other adaptive container controls, such as {@link
   * sap.m.Breadcrumbs}, results in competition for the available space - both controls calculate the available
   * space based on the other one's size and both change their width at the same time, leading to incorrectly
   * distributed space.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * The height of the toolbar changes on desktop, tablet, and smartphones.

  /**
   * A container control that holds one whole screen of an application.
   *
   * Overview: The sap.m.Page is a container control that holds one whole screen of an application. The page
   * has three distinct areas that can hold content - a header, content area and a footer. Structure: Header:
   * The top most area of the page is occupied by the header. The standard header includes a navigation button
   * and a title. Alternatively, you can create your own custom header, which is defined in the `customHeader`
   * aggregation. Content: The content occupies the main part of the page. Only the content area is scrollable
   * by default. This can be prevented by setting `enableScrolling` to `false`. Footer: The footer is optional
   * and occupies the fixed bottom part of the page. Alternatively, the footer can be floating above the bottom
   * part of the content. This is enabled with the `floatingFooter` property.
   *
   * **Note:** All accessibility information for the different areas and their corresponding ARIA roles is
   * set in the aggregation `landmarkInfo` of type {@link sap.m.PageAccessibleLandmarkInfo} Responsive Behavior:
   * When using the sap.m.Page in SAP Quartz theme, the breakpoints and layout paddings could be determined
   * by the container's width. To enable this concept and add responsive paddings to an element of the Page
   * control, you may add the following classes depending on your use case: `sapUiResponsivePadding--header`,
   * `sapUiResponsivePadding--subHeader`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--content`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--footer`,
   * `sapUiResponsivePadding--floatingFooter`.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.16
   *
   * A container control which has a header and content. Overview: The panel is a container for grouping and
   * displaying information. It can be collapsed to save space on the screen. Guidelines::
   * 	 - Nesting two or more panels is not recommended.
   * 	 - Do not stack too many panels on one page.  Structure: A panel consists of a title bar with a
   * 			header text or header toolbar, an info toolbar (optional), and a content area. Using the `headerToolbar`
   * 			aggregation, you can add a toolbar with any toolbar content (i.e. custom buttons, spacers, titles) inside
   * 			the title bar.
   *
   * There are two types of panels: fixed and expandable. Expendable panels are enabled by the `expandable`
   * property. Furthermore you can define an expand animation with the property `expandAnimation`. Usage:
   * When to use::
   * 	 - You need to group or display information and want to give users the option of hiding this information.
   *
   * 	 - You want to show additional information on demand (for example, a panel could show optional input
   * 			fields for an advanced search).
   * 	 - You want to create a panel with controls that do not require user interaction and are not part of
   * 			a form. Depending on the usage, change the `accessibleRole` property from the default `{@link sap.m.PanelAccessibleRole
   * 			Form}` to `{@link sap.m.PanelAccessibleRole Region}` or `{@link sap.m.PanelAccessibleRole Complementary}`.
   * 			 Responsive Behavior:
   * 	 - If the width of the panel is set to 100% (default), the panel and its children are resized responsively,
   * 			depending on its parent container.
   * 	 - If the panel has a fixed defined height, it will take up the space, even if the panel is collapsed.
   *
   * 	 - When the panel is expandable, an arrow icon (pointing to the right) appears in front of the header.
   *
   * 	 - When the animation is activated, expand/collapse uses a smooth animation to open or close the content
   * 			area.
   * 	 - When the panel expands/collapses, the arrow icon rotates 90 degrees clockwise/counter-clockwise.
   *
   * 	 - When the height uses the default property `auto`, the height of the content area is automatically
   * 			adjusted to match the height of its content.
   * 	 - When the height of the panel is set to a fixed size, the content area can be scrolled through.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.34
   *
   * Displays rows with appointments for different entities (such as persons or teams) for the selected time
   * interval.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * You can use the `PlanningCalendar` to represent a calendar containing multiple rows with appointments,
   * where each row represents a different person.
   *
   * You can configure different time-interval views that the user can switch between, such as hours or days,
   * and even a whole week/month. The available navigation allows the user to select a specific interval using
   * a picker, or move to the previous/next interval using arrows.
   *
   * **Note:** The `PlanningCalendar` uses parts of the `sap.ui.unified` library. This library will be loaded
   * after the `PlanningCalendar`, if it wasn't loaded first. This could lead to a waiting time when a `PlanningCalendar`
   * is used for the first time. To prevent this, apps that use the `PlanningCalendar` should also load the
   * `sap.ui.unified` library.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * The `PlanningCalendar` has the following structure from top to bottom:
   *
   *
   * 	 - A toolbar where you can add your own buttons or other controls using the `toolbarContent` aggregation.
   *
   * 	 - A header containing a drop-down menu for selecting the {@link sap.m.PlanningCalendarView PlanningCalendarViews},
   * 			and navigation for moving through the intervals using arrows or selecting a specific interval with a
   * 			picker. Custom views can be configured using the `views` aggregation. If not configured, the following
   * 			set of default built-in views is available - Hours, Days, 1 Week, 1 Month, and Months. Setting a custom
   * 			view(s) replaces the built-in ones.
   * 	 - The rows of the `PlanningCalendar` that contain the assigned appointments. They can be configured
   * 			with the `rows` aggregation, which is of type {@link sap.m.PlanningCalendarRow PlanningCalendarRow}.
   *
   *
   * Since 1.48 the empty space in the cell that is below an appointment can be removed by adding the `sapUiCalendarAppFitVertically`
   * CSS class to the `PlanningCalendar`. Please note that it should be used only for a `PlanningCalendar`
   * with one appointment per day for a row that doesn't have interval headers set.
   *
   * Since 1.44 alternating row colors can be suppressed by adding the `sapMPlanCalSuppressAlternatingRowColors`
   * CSS class to the `PlanningCalendar`.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * You can define the number of displayed intervals based on the size of the `PlanningCalendar` using the
   * {@link sap.m.PlanningCalendarView PlanningCalendarView}'s properties.

  /**
   * Displays additional information for an object in a compact way.
   *
   * Overview: The popover displays additional information for an object in a compact way and without leaving
   * the page. The popover can contain various UI elements such as fields, tables, images, and charts. It
   * can also include actions in the footer. Structure: The popover has three main areas:
   * 	 - Header (optional) - with a back button and a title
   * 	 - Content - holds all the controls
   * 	 - Footer (optional) - with additional action buttons  Guidelines:
   * 	 - Do not overlap popovers.
   * 	 - You can determine the {@link sap.m.PlacementType placement} of the popover relative to the control
   * 			that opens it.
   * 	 - Ensure that the content has a basic design and shows only the most important information.  Usage:
   * 			When to use::
   * 	 - You need to define your own structure of controls within the popover.  When not to use::
   *
   * 	 - The {@link sap.m.QuickView QuickView} is more appropriate for your use case.  Responsive Behavior:
   * 			The popover is closed when the user clicks or taps outside the popover or selects an action within the
   * 			popover, which calls the popover's `close()` method. You can prevent this with the `modal` property.
   * 			The popover can be resized when the `resizable` property is enabled.
   *
   * When using the sap.m.Popover in Sap Quartz theme, the breakpoints and layout paddings could be determined
   * by the container's width. To enable this concept and add responsive paddings to an element of the Popover
   * control, you may add the following classes depending on your use case: `sapUiResponsivePadding--header`,
   * `sapUiResponsivePadding--subHeader`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--content`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--footer`.
   *
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.Popover} is not responsive on mobile devices - it will always be rendered as
   * 			a popover and you have to take care of its size and position.
   * 	 - {@link sap.m.ResponsivePopover} is adaptive and responsive. It renders as a dialog with a close button
   * 			in the header on phones, and as a popover on tablets.

   * A responsive popover that displays information on an object in a business-card format. Overview: The

   * uses a set of pre-defined controls. Objects can be linked together and you can navigate between several
   * objects. An unlimited number of objects can be linked. Structure: Each card is represented by a {@link

   * A single quick view can hold multiple objects, each showing information on a single entity. Usage: When
   * to use:
   * 	 - You want to display a concise overview of an object (an employee or a company).
   * 	 - Information on the object can be split into concrete groups.  When not to use:
   * 	 - You want to display complex information about an object.  Responsive Behavior: The quick view
   * 			is displayed in a {@link sap.m.Popover popover} on desktop and a full-screen {@link sap.m.Dialog dialog}

  /**
   * RadioButton is a control similar to a {@link sap.m.CheckBox checkbox}, but it allows you to choose only
   * one of the predefined set of options. Multiple radio buttons have to belong to the same group (have the
   * same value for `groupName`) in order to be mutually exclusive.
   *
   * It is recommended to use the wrapper control {@link sap.m.RadioButtonGroup RadioButtonGroup} instead
   * of individual radio buttons. This will provide better screen reader support for the user. Use the `RadioButton`
   * control on its own only if there is a wrapper control that handles the screen reader support. For example,
   * such wrappers are sap.m.List, sap.m.Table and sap.f.GridList.
   *
   * Structure:
   * 	 - Radio buttons can have a value state like Error or Warning.
   * 	 - Radio buttons can be arranged vertically by setting the `column` to a number higher than 1.
   * 	 - Radio button options need to have a {@link sap.m.Label label}.  Usage: When to use::
   * 	 - You quickly need to choose between at least two alternatives.
   * 	 - You need to place other controls between the radio button options.  When not to use::
   * 	 - You want to select multiple values for the same option. Use {@link sap.m.CheckBox checkboxes} instead.
   *
   * 	 - When the default value is recommended for most users in most situations. Use a {@link sap.m.Select
   * 			drop-down} instead as is saves space by not showing all the alternatives.
   * 	 - You want have more than 8 options. Use a {@link sap.m.Select drop-down} instead.
   * 	 - When the options are mutually exclusive e.g. ON/OFF. Use a {@link sap.m.Switch switch} instead.
   * 	 - Avoid using horizontally aligned radio buttons as they will be cut off on phones.
   *
   * **Note:** The order in which the RadioButtons will be selected one after another is determined upon instantiation
   * of the control. This order is consistent with the ARIA attributes for position, which the same button
   * will receive when added to specific group.
   *
   * **Example:** If three buttons are created (`button1, button2, button3`) in consecutive order, initially
   * they will have the same positions and TAB order. However if after that `button1` and `button3` are moved
   * to a new group and then `button2` is added to the same group, their TAB order and position in this group
   * will be `button1, button3, button2`.

   * The functionality of the routematched handler is built in into these two classes, there is no need to
   * create this anymore.
   *
   * This class will attach to the Events of a provided router and add the views created by it to a {@link
   * sap.m.SplitContainer} or a {@link sap.m.NavContainer} Control, if this is the target control of the route.
   *  If the targetControl is no {@link sap.m.SplitContainer} or a {@link sap.m.NavContainer}, It will only
   * close the dialogs, according to the property value.
   *
   *  When a navigation is triggered, this class will try to determine the transition of the pages based on
   * the history.
   *  Eg: if a user presses browser back, it will show a backwards animation.
   *
   *  The navigation on the container takes place in the RoutePatternMatched event of the Router. If you register
   * on the RouteMatched event of the Router, the visual navigation did not take place yet.
   *
   *  Since it is hard to detect if a user has pressed browser back, this transitions will not be reliable,
   * for example if someone bookmarked a detail page, and wants to navigate to a masterPage.
   *  If you want this case to always show a backwards transition, you should specify a "viewLevel" property
   * on your Route.
   *  The viewLevel has to be an integer. The Master should have a lower number than the detail.
   *  These levels should represent the user process of your application and they do not have to match the
   * container structure of your Routes.
   *  If the user navigates between views with the same viewLevel, the history is asked for the direction.
   *
   *  You can specify a property "transition" in a route to define which transition will be applied when navigating.
   * If it is not defined, the nav container will take its default transition.
   *  You can also specify "transitionParameters" on a Route, to give the transition parameters.
   *
   *  preservePageInSplitContainer is deprecated since 1.28 since Targets make this parameter obsolete. If
   * you want to preserve the current view when navigating, but you want to navigate to it when nothing is
   * displayed in the navContainer, you can set preservePageInSplitContainer = true
   *  When the route that has this flag directly matches the pattern, the view will still be switched by the
   * splitContainer.

   * 			a “starts with” approach.
   * 	 - Live search (search-as-you-type) - The search is triggered after each button press. A suggestion

   *
   * 	 -  Use live search whenever possible.
   * 	 -  Use a manual search only if the amount of data is too large and if your app would otherwise run
   * 			into performance issues.   Responsive Behavior: On mobile devices, there is no refresh button in
   * 			the search field. "Pull Down to Refresh" is used instead. The "Pull Down to Refresh" arrow icon is animated

  /**
   * Overview: A SelectDialog is a dialog containing a list, search functionality to filter it and a confirmation/cancel
   * button. The list used in the dialog is a growing list and can be filled with any kind of list item. Structure:
   * Dialog structure: The select dialog has the following components:
   * 	 - Header - title of the dialog
   * 	 - Search field - input field to enter search terms
   * 	 - Info toolbar (only in multi-select) - displays the number of currently selected items
   * 	 - Content - {@link sap.m.StandardListItem standard list items}, {@link sap.m.DisplayListItem display
   * 			list items} or {@link sap.m.FeedListItem feed list items}
   * 	 - Button toolbar - for confirmation/cancellation buttons   List structure & selection:
   * 	 -  The search field triggers the events `search` and `liveChange` where a filter function can be applied
   * 			to the list binding.
   * 	 -  The growing functionality of the list does not support two-way Binding, so if you use this control
   * 			with a JSON model make sure the binding mode is set to `OneWay` and that you update the selection model
   * 			manually with the items passed in the `confirm` event.
   * 	 -  In the multi-select mode of the select dialog, checkboxes are provided for choosing multiple entries.
   *
   * 	 -  You can set `rememberSelections` to `true` to store the current selection and load this state when
   * 			the dialog is opened again.
   * 	 -  When cancelling the selection, the event `change` will be fired and the selection is restored to
   * 			the state when the dialog was opened.
   * 	 - The SelectDialog is usually displayed at the center of the screen. Its size and position can be changed
   * 			by the user. To enable this you need to set the `resizable` and `draggable` properties. Both properties
   * 			are available only in desktop mode.  Usage: When to use::
   * 	 - You need to select one or more entries from a comprehensive list that contains multiple attributes
   * 			or values.   When not to use::
   * 	 -  You need to pick one item from a predefined set of options. Use {@link sap.m.Select select} or {@link
   * 			sap.m.ComboBox combobox} instead.
   * 	 -  You need to select a range of item. Use {@link sap.ui.comp.valuehelpdialog.ValueHelpDialog value
   * 			help dialog} instead.
   * 	 -  You need to be able to add your own values to an existing list. Use a {@link sap.m.Dialog dialog}
   * 			instead.   Note:: The property `growing` determines the progressive loading. If it's set to `true`
   * 			(the default value), the selected count (if present) and search, will work for currently loaded items
   * 			only. To make sure that all items in the list are loaded at once and the above features works properly,
   * 			we recommend setting the `growing` property to `false`. Responsive Behavior:
   * 	 -  On phones, the select dialog takes up the whole screen.
   * 	 -  On desktop and tablet devices, the select dialog appears as a popover.   When using the `sap.m.SelectDialog`
   * 			in SAP Quartz themes, the breakpoints and layout paddings could be determined by the dialog's width.
   * 			To enable this concept and add responsive paddings to an element of the control, you have to add the
   * 			following classes depending on your use case: `sapUiResponsivePadding--header`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--subHeader`,
   * 			`sapUiResponsivePadding--content`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--footer`.

   *
   * An enhanced {@link sap.m.Page}, that can contain controls with semantic meaning, see {@link sap.m.semantic.SemanticControl}.
   *
   * **Note:** This control implements the SAP Fiori 1.0 design guidelines. For SAP Fiori 2.0, see the {@link
   * sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage}.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The main functionality of the `SemanticPage` is to predefine the placement, behavior and styles of the
   * page elements.
   *
   * Content specified in the semantic aggregations will be automatically positioned in dedicated sections
   * of the footer or the header of the page.
   *
   * Structure:
   *
   * The semantics of the content are the following:
   * 	 - Visual properties (for example, `AddAction` will be styled as an icon button)
   * 	 - Position in the page (UX guidelines specify that some buttons should be in the header only, while
   * 			others are in the footer or the "share" menu, so we do the correct positioning)
   * 	 - Sequence order (UX guidelines define a specific sequence order of semantic controls with respect
   * 			to each other)
   * 	 - Default localized tooltip for icon-only buttons
   * 	 - Overflow behavior (UX guidelines define which buttons are allowed to go to the overflow of the toolbar
   * 			when the screen gets narrower). For icon buttons, we ensure that the text label of the button appears
   * 			when the button is in overflow, as specified by UX.
   * 	 - Screen reader support (invisible text for reading the semantic type)
   *
   * In addition to the predefined semantic controls, the `SemanticPage` can host also custom app controls.
   * It preserves most of the API of the {@link sap.m.Page} for specifying page content.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * The app developer only has to specify the action type, and the required styling and positioning are automatically
   * added.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.61
   *
   * Displays a calendar of a single entity (such as person, resource) for the selected time interval.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * **Note:** The `SinglePlanningCalendar` uses parts of the `sap.ui.unified` library. This library will
   * be loaded after the `SinglePlanningCalendar`, if it wasn't previously loaded. This could lead to a waiting
   * time when a `SinglePlanningCalendar` is used for the first time. To prevent this, apps using the `SinglePlanningCalendar`
   * must also load the `sap.ui.unified` library.
   *
   * The `SinglePlanningCalendar` has the following structure:
   *
   *
   * 	A `PlanningCalendarHeader` at the top. It contains the `title` set from the corresponding property,
   * the `SegmentedButton`, which facilitates navigation through the views, controls, passed to the `actions`
   * aggregation and the navigation, assisting the user in choosing the desired time period. The views, either
   * custom or not, can be configured and passed through the `views` aggregation.
   *
   * To create custom views, extend the `SinglePlanningCalendarView` basic view class. It defines three methods
   * that should be overwritten: `getEntityCount`, `getScrollEntityCount` and `calculateStartDate`
   * 	 - `getEntityCount` - returns number of columns to be displayed
   * 	 - `getScrollEntityCount` - used when next and previous arrows in the calendar are used. For example,
   * 			in work week view, the `getEntityCount` returns 5 (5 columns from Monday to Friday), but when next arrow
   * 			is selected, the control navigates 7 days ahead and `getScrollEntityCount` returns 7.
   * 	 - `calculateStartDate` - calculates the first day displayed in the calendar based on the `startDate`
   * 			property of the `SinglePlanningCalendar`. For example, it returns the first date of a month or a week
   * 			to display the first 10 days of the month.
   *
   * A `SinglePlanningCalendarGrid` or `SinglePlanningCalendarMonthGrid`, which displays the appointments,
   * set to the visual time range. An all-day appointment is an appointment which starts at 00:00 and ends
   * in 00:00 on any day in the future.

  /**
   * Overview:
   *
   * A {@link sap.m.Slider} control represents a numerical range and a handle. The purpose of the control
   * is to enable visual selection of a value in a continuous numerical range by moving an adjustable handle.
   *
   * **Notes:**
   * 	 - Only horizontal sliders are possible.
   * 	 - The handle can be moved in steps of predefined size. This is done with the `step` property.
   * 	 - Setting the property `showAdvancedTooltip` shows an input field above the handle
   * 	 - Setting the property `inputsAsTooltips` enables the user to enter a specific value in the handle's
   * 			tooltip.
   *
   * Structure:
   *
   * The most important properties of the Slider are:
   * 	 -  min - The minimum value of the slider range
   * 	 -  max - The maximum value of the slider range
   * 	 -  value - The current value of the slider
   * 	 -  progress - Determines if a progress bar will be shown on the slider range
   * 	 -  step - Determines the increments in which the slider will move  These properties determine
   * 			the visualization of the tooltips:
   * 	 -  `showAdvancedTooltip` - Determines if a tooltip should be displayed above the handle
   * 	 -  `inputsAsTooltips` - Determines if the tooltip displayed above the slider's handle should include
   * 			an input field
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * The most common usecase is to select values on a continuous numerical scale (e.g. temperature, volume,
   * etc. ).
   *
   * Responsive Behavior:
   *
   * The `sap.m.Slider` control adjusts to the size of its parent container by recalculating and resizing
   * the width of the control. You can move the slider handle in several different ways:
   * 	 -  Drag and drop to the desired value
   * 	 -  Click/tap on the range bar to move the handle to that location
   * 	 -  Enter the desired value in the input field (if available)
   * 	 -  Keyboard (Arrow keys, "+" and "-")

  /**
   * A container control that is used to display a master-detail view.
   *
   * Overview: The SplitContainer divides the screen into two areas:
   * 	 - Master area - contains a list of available items where the user can search and filter.
   * 	 - Details area - contains a control which shows further details on the item(s) selected from the master
   * 			view.  Both areas have separate headers and footer bars with navigation and actions.
   *
   * Usage: SplitContainer should take the full width of the page in order to work properly. When to use:
   *
   * 	 - You need to review and process different items quickly with minimal navigation.  When not to
   * 			use:
   * 	 - You need to offer complex filters for the list of items.
   * 	 - You need to see different attributes for each item in the list, and compare these values across items.
   *
   * 	 - You want to display a single object. Do not use the master list to display different facets of the
   * 			same object.
   *
   * Responsive Behavior: On narrow screens, such as phones or tablet devices in portrait mode, the master
   * list and the details are split into two separate pages. The user can navigate between the list and details,
   * and see all the available information for each area.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.40
   *
   * Allows the user to change the input values with predefined increments (steps).
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `StepInput` consists of an input field and buttons with icons to increase/decrease the value.
   *
   * The user can change the value of the control by pressing the increase/decrease buttons, by typing a number
   * directly, by using the keyboard up/down and page up/down, or by using the mouse scroll wheel. Decimal
   * values are supported.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * The default step is 1 but the app developer can set a different one.
   *
   * On desktop, the control supports a larger step, when using the keyboard page up/down keys. You can set
   * a multiple of the step with the use of the `largerStep` property. The default value is 2 (two times the
   * set step). For example, when using the keyboard page up/down keys the value increases/decreases with
   * a double of the default step. If the set step is 2, the larger step is also 2 and the current value is
   * 1, using the page up key will increase the value to 5 (1 + 2*2).
   *
   * App developers can set a maximum and minimum value for the `StepInput`. The increase/decrease button
   * and the up/down keyboard navigation become disabled when the value reaches the max/min or a new value
   * is entered from the input which is greater/less than the max/min.
   *
   * When to use
   * 	 - To adjust amounts, quantities, or other values quickly.
   * 	 - To adjust values for a specific step.
   *
   * When not to use
   * 	 - To enter a static number (for example, postal code, phone number, or ID). In this case, use the regular
   * 			{@link sap.m.Input} instead.
   * 	 - To display a value that rarely needs to be adjusted and does not pertain to a particular step. In
   * 			this case, use the regular {@link sap.m.Input} instead.
   * 	 - To enter dates and times. In this case, use the {@link sap.m.DatePicker}, {@link sap.m.DateRangeSelection},
   * 			{@link sap.m.TimePicker}, or {@link sap.m.DateTimePicker} instead.
   *
   * **Note:** The control uses a JavaScript number to keep its value, which has a certain precision limit.
   *
   * In general, exponential notation is used:
   * 	 - if there are more than 21 digits before the decimal point.
   * 	 - if number starts with "0." followed by more than five zeros.
   *
   * Exponential notation is not supported by the control and using it may lead to unpredictable behavior.
   *
   * Also, the JavaScript number persists its precision up to 16 digits. If the user enters a number with
   * a greater precision, the value will be rounded.
   *
   * This restriction comes from JavaScript itself and it cannot be worked around in a feasible way.
   *
   * **Note:** Formatting of decimal numbers is browser dependent, regardless of framework number formatting.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.34
   *
   * A container control for managing multiple tabs, allowing the user to open and edit different items simultaneously.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The control contains a `TabStrip` area where the user can choose which tab to view/edit. When the open
   * tabs are more than what can be displayed on the screen, there is an overflow mechanism. To access the
   * tabs hidden in the overflow area, the user has to either use the overflow button (left or right arrow)
   * to scroll them horizontally or the overflow overview button (down arrow) and view all open items as a
   * list.
   *
   * Each tab has a title and a Close Tab button. The title is truncated, if it's longer than 25 characters.
   * On desktop, the Close Tab button is displayed on the currently active tab and for the other tabs
   * it appears on mouse hover. On mobile devices, the Close Tab buttons are always visible.
   *
   * To show that the open items have unsaved changes, the corresponding tabs can display an asterisk (*)
   * after the title as a visual indication that the item is not saved. This is managed by the app developer
   * using {@link sap.m.TabContainerItem TabContainerItem}'s `modified` property.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * The `TabContainer` can have an Add New Tab button, which appears as a '+' icon on the top-right
   * area of the control. When the user clicks or taps this button, the `addNewButtonPress` event is fired.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * The `TabContainer` is a full-page container that takes 100% of its parent width and height. As the control
   * is expected to occupy the whole parent, it should be the only child of its parent.
   *
   * When using the `sap.m.TabContainer` in SAP Quartz theme, the breakpoints and layout paddings could be
   * determined by the container's width. To enable this concept and add responsive padding to the `TabContainer`
   * control, you may add the following class: `sapUiResponsivePadding--header`.

     * the cells. Cells in subsequent rows do not affect column width. This allows a browser to provide a faster
     * table layout since the browser can begin to display the table once the first row has been analyzed.
     *
     * If this property is set to `false`, `sap.m.Table` is rendered with an auto layout algorithm. This means,
     * the width of the table and its cells depends on the content of the cells. The column width is set by
     * the widest unbreakable content inside the cells. This can make the rendering slow, since the browser
     * needs to go through all the content in the table before determining the final layout.
     *
     *
     * If this property is set to `Strict` and the `width` property is defined for all columns (and not the
     * expected "auto" value), then the `sap.m.Table` control renders a placeholder column which occupies the
     * remaining width of the control to ensure the column width setting is strictly applied.
     *

     * If there is only one remaining column with a width larger than the table, then this column gets the maximum
     * width available in the table. If the column width is smaller than the table, then the column width is
     * retained, and the remaining width of the table is occupied by the placeholder column.
     *
     *
     * The placeholder column gets rendered only if there are no columns in the pop-in area.
     *
     *
     * **Note:** Since `sap.m.Table` does not have its own scrollbars, setting `fixedLayout` to false can force
     * the table to overflow, which may cause visual problems. It is suggested to use this property when a table
     * has a few columns in wide screens or within the horizontal scroll container (e.g `sap.m.Dialog`) to handle
     * overflow. In auto layout mode the `width` property of `sap.m.Column` is taken into account as a minimum

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.16
   *
   * A dialog to select items in a table containing multiple values and attributes. Overview: The table select
   * dialog helps users select items in a table-like structure with several attributes and values per item.
   * A search fields helps narrow down the results. Structure: The table select dialog consists of the following
   * elements:
   * 	 -  Search field - used to search enter search terms for a specific item.
   * 	 -  Info toolbar (only in multi-select mode) - displays the number of currently selected items.
   * 	 -  Content - the table with the items.
   * 	 -  Footer (optional) - a toolbar for actions.  Table Select Dialog supports multi-selection when
   * 			the `multiSelect` property is set to `true`.
   *
   * The selected items can be stored for later editing when the `rememberSelections` property is set. **Note:**
   * This property has to be set before the dialog is opened. Usage: When to use::
   * 	 - You need to select one or more items from a comprehensive list that contains multiple attributes
   * 			or values.  When not to use::
   * 	 - You need to select only one item from a predefined list of single-value options. Use the {@link sap.m.Select
   * 			Select} control instead.
   * 	 - You need to display complex content without having the user navigate away from the current page or
   * 			you want to prompt the user for an action. Use the {@link sap.m.Dialog Dialog} control instead.
   * 	 - You need to select items within a query-based range. Use the {@link https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/value-help-dialog/
   * 			Value Help Dialog} control instead.
   * 	 - You need to filter a set of items without any selection. Use the {@link https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-web/filter-bar/
   * 			Filter Bar} control instead.  Notes::
   * 	 - The property `growing` must not be used together with two-way binding. When the property `growing`
   * 			is set to `true` (default value), selected count (if present) and search, will work for currently loaded
   * 			items only. To make sure that all items in the table are loaded at once and the above features work properly,
   * 			set the property to `false`. Since version 1.58, the columns headers and the info toolbar are sticky
   * 			(remain fixed on top when scrolling). This feature is not supported in all browsers. The TableSelectDialog
   * 			is usually displayed at the center of the screen. Its size and position can be changed by the user. To
   * 			enable this you need to set the `resizable` and `draggable` properties. Both properties are available
   * 			only in desktop mode. For more information on browser support limitations, you can refer to the {@link
   * 			sap.m.ListBase sap.m.ListBase} `sticky` property.  Responsive Behavior:
   * 	 - On smaller screens, the columns of the table wrap and build a list that shows all the information.
   * 			 When using the `sap.m.TableSelectDialog` in SAP Quartz themes, the breakpoints and layout paddings
   * 			could be determined by the dialog's width. To enable this concept and add responsive paddings to an element
   * 			of the control, you have to add the following classes depending on your use case: `sapUiResponsivePadding--header`,
   * 			`sapUiResponsivePadding--subHeader`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--content`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--footer`.

   * A control that is used for multi-line input of text. Overview: The text area is used to enter multiple

   * define the height and width of the text area and also determine specific behavior when handling long
   * texts. Structure: Parameters that determine the size:
   * 	 - `rows` - Number of visible text lines (overruled by `height`, if both are set)
   * 	 - `cols` - Number of visible characters per line line (overruled by `width`, if both are set)
   * 	 - `height` - Height of the control
   * 	 - `width` - Width of the control  Parameters that determine the behavior:
   * 	 - `growing` - The text area adjusts its size based on the content
   * 	 - `growingMaxLines` - Threshold for the `growing` property (shouldn't exceed the screen size)
   * 	 - `maxLength` - Maximum number of characters that can be entered in a text area
   * 	 - `wrapping` - The way the entered text is wrapped by the control
   * 	 - `showExceededText` - Determines how text beyond the `maxLength` length is handled  Usage: When
   * 			to use:
   * 	 - You want to enter multiple lines of text.
   * 	 - Always provide labels for a text area.
   * 	 - A placeholder does not substitute a label.  Responsive Behavior:
   * 	 - On smaller screens, you can scroll down the text area to see the entire text. To indicate that the
   * 			text continues, the control shows only half of the last line.
   * 	 - If you have a growing text area, have in mind that its maximum height should not exceed the height
   * 			of the screen. If that is the case, the screen height is used instead.
   * 	 - If `showExceededText` is set to TRUE and you paste a longer text, all characters beyond the `maxLength`
   * 			limit are automatically selected. If `showExceededText` is set to TRUE, the control will display
   * 			a counter for the remaining characters.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.32
   *
   * A single-field input control that enables the users to fill time related input fields.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `TimePicker` control enables the users to fill time related input fields using touch, mouse, or keyboard
   * input.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * Use this control if you want the user to select a time. If you want the user to select a duration (1
   * hour), use the {@link sap.m.Select} control instead.
   *
   * The user can fill time by:
   *
   *
   * 	 - Using the time picker button that opens a popover with а time picker clock dial
   * 	 - Using the time input field. On desktop - by changing the time directly via keyboard input. On mobile/touch
   * 			device - in another input field that opens in a popup after tap.
   *
   * On app level, there are two options to provide value for the `TimePicker` - as a string to the `value`
   * property or as a JavaScript Date object to the `dateValue` property (only one of these properties should
   * be used at a time):
   *
   *
   * 	 - Use the `value` property if you want to bind the `TimePicker` to a model using the `sap.ui.model.type.Time`
   *
   * 	 - Use the `value` property if the date is provided as a string from the backend or inside the app (for
   * 			example, as ABAP type DATS field)
   * 	 - Use the `dateValue` property if the date is already provided as a JavaScript Date object or you want
   * 			to work with a JavaScript Date object. Use `dateValue` as a helper property to easily obtain the hours,
   * 			minutes and seconds of the chosen time. Although possible to bind it, the recommendation is to not to
   * 			do it. When binding is needed, use `value` property instead
   *
   * Formatting:
   *
   * All formatting and parsing of values from and to strings is done using the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat}.
   * If a value is entered by typing it into the input field, it must fit to the used time format and locale.
   *
   * Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation. See {@link http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Date_Field_Symbol_Table}
   *
   * A time format must be specified, otherwise the default "HH:mm:ss a" will be used. For example, if the
   * `valueFormat` is "HH-mm-ss a", the `displayFormat` is "HH:mm:ss a", and the used locale is English, a
   * valid value string is "10-30-15 AM", which leads to an output of "10:30:15 AM".
   *
   * If no placeholder is set to the `TimePicker`, the used `displayFormat` is displayed as a placeholder.
   * If another placeholder is needed, it must be set.
   *
   * **Note:** If the string does NOT match the `displayFormat` (from user input) or the `valueFormat` (on
   * app level), the {@link sap.ui.core.format.DateFormat} makes an attempt to parse it based on the locale
   * settings. For more information, see the respective documentation in the API Reference.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * The `TimePicker` is responsive and fully adapts to all device types. For larger screens, such as tablet
   * or desktop, it opens as a popover. For mobile devices, it opens in full screen.

   *
   * Overview: The `Title` control is a simple, large-sized text containing additional semantic information
   * for accessibility purposes.
   *
   * As of version 1.52, you can truncate or wrap long titles if the screen is narrower than the full title
   * by using the with the use of the `wrapping` property.
   *
   * As of version 1.60, you can hyphenate the label's text with the use of the `wrappingType` property. For
   * more information, see {@link topic:6322164936f047de941ec522b95d7b70 Text Controls Hyphenation}.
   *
   * As of version 1.87, you can set the `content` aggregation to use `sap.m.Link` or any control that implements
   * `sap.ui.core.ITitleContent` interface. This control will be rendered instead of the text placed in `text`
   * property. In this case the following properties of `sap.m.Title` control are overridden: `text`, `textAlign`,
   * `textDirection`, or not used: `wrapping`, `wrappingType`. The `title` association will be ignored too.
   *
   * If the `title` association is used, `text`, `level` and `tooltip` properties will override the corresponding
   * properties of the `sap.m.Title` control.
   *

   * @SINCE 1.16
   *
   * Horizontal container most commonly used to display buttons, labels, selects and various other input controls.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * By default, the `Toolbar` items are shrinkable if they have percent-based width (for example, {@link
   * sap.m.Input} and {@link sap.m.Slider}) or implement the {@link sap.ui.core.IShrinkable} interface (for
   * example, {@link sap.m.Text} and {@link sap.m.Label}). This behavior can be overridden by providing {@link
   * sap.m.ToolbarLayoutData} for the `Toolbar` items.
   *
   * **Note:** It is recommended that you use {@link sap.m.OverflowToolbar} over `sap.m.Toolbar`, unless you
   * want to avoid the overflow behavior in favor of shrinking.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * You can add a visual separator between the preceding and succeeding {@link sap.m.Toolbar} item with the
   * use of the {@link sap.m.ToolbarSeparator}. The separator is theme dependent and can be a padding, a margin
   * or a line.
   *
   * To add horizontal space between the `Toolbar` items, use the {@link sap.m.ToolbarSpacer}. You can define
   * the width of the horizontal space or make it flexible to cover the remaining space between the `Toolbar`
   * items (for example, to to push an item to the edge of the `Toolbar`.
   *
   * **Note:** The {@link sap.m.ToolbarSpacer} is a flex control that is intended to control its own behavior,
   * thus {@link sap.m.ToolbarLayoutData} is not supported as value for the `layoutData` aggregation of {@link
   * sap.m.ToolbarSpacer} and if set it's ignored.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.16
   *
   * Helps the user to sort, filter, or group data within a (master) {@link sap.m.List} or a {@link sap.m.Table}.
   * The dialog is triggered by icon buttons in the table toolbar. Each button shows a dropdown list icon.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The `ViewSettingsDialog` is a composite control, consisting of a modal {@link sap.m.Popover} and several
   * internal lists. There are three different tabs (Sort, Group, Filter) in the dialog that can be activated
   * by filling the respective associations. If only one association is filled, the other tabs are automatically
   * hidden. The selected options can be used to create sorters and filters for the table.
   *
   * **Note:** If the app does not offer all three sorting, filtering, and grouping operations, but only one
   * of these (such as sort), we recommend placing the icon button directly in the toolbar. Do not place sort,
   * filter, or group buttons in the footer toolbar if they refer to a table. Place group, sort, and filter
   * buttons in the footer toolbar if they refer to a master list.
   *
   * **Note:** If `ViewSettingsDialog` is used without custom tabs or custom items in any of its aggregations,
   * then Reset button is enabled if the user selects any Filters or presetFilters or changes any of the Sort
   * by, Sort order, Group by, or Group order values. When `ViewSettingsDialog` is used with custom tabs or
   * custom items in any of its aggregations (sortItems, groupItems, filterItems or presetFilterItems), the
   * Reset button is always enabled, because there is no way to determine the initial state of the custom
   * tabs and compare it to their current state in order to determine the enable/disable state of the Reset
   * button.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * When to use?
   * 	 - If you need to allow the user to sort line items in a manageable list or table (up to 20 columns)
   *
   * 	 - If you need to offer custom filter settings in a manageable list or table (up to 20 columns)
   * 	 - If you need to allow the user to group line items in a manageable list or table (up to 20 columns)
   *
   * When not to use?
   * 	 - If you have complex tables (more than 20 columns)
   * 	 - If you need to rearrange columns within your table (use the {@link sap.m.TablePersoDialog} instead)
   *
   * 	 - If you need very specific sort, filter, or column sorting options within complex tables (use the
   * 			{@link sap.m.P13nDialog} instead)
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * The popover dialog appears as a modal window on desktop and tablet screen sizes, but full screen on smartphones.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.30
   *
   * Enables users to accomplish a single goal which consists of multiple dependable sub-tasks. Overview:
   * The sap.m.Wizard helps users complete a complex and unfamiliar task by dividing it into sections and
   * guiding the user through it. The wizard has two main areas - a navigation area at the top showing the
   * step sequence and a content area below it. Structure: Navigation Area: The top most area of the wizard
   * is occupied by the navigation area. It shows the sequence of {@link sap.m.WizardStep wizard steps}.
   *
   * 	 - The minimum number of steps is 3 and the maximum is 8 and are stored in the `steps` aggregation.
   *
   * 	 - Steps can be branching depending on choices the user made in their input - this is set by the `enableBranching`
   * 			property.
   * 	 - Steps can have different visual representations - numbers or icons. You can add labels for better
   * 			readability   Content: The content occupies the main part of the page. It can hold any type of input
   * 			controls. The content is kept in {@link sap.m.WizardStep wizard steps}. Next Step Button: The next step
   * 			button is displayed below the content. It can be hidden by setting `showNextButton` to `false` and displayed,
   * 			for example, only after the user has filled all mandatory fields. Usage: When to use:: When the user
   * 			has to accomplish a long or unfamiliar task. When not to use:: When the user has to accomplish a routine
   * 			task that is clear and familiar. When the task has only two steps or less. Responsive Behavior: On mobile
   * 			devices the steps in the StepNavigator are grouped together and overlap. Tapping on them will show a
   * 			popover to select the step to navigate to.
   *
   * When using the sap.m.Wizard in SAP Quartz theme, the breakpoints and layout paddings could be determined
   * by the container's width. To enable this concept and add responsive paddings to the navigation area and
   * to the content of the Wizard control, you may add the following classes depending on your use case: `sapUiResponsivePadding--header`,
   * `sapUiResponsivePadding--content`.
   *
   * As the `sap.m.Wizard` is a layout control, when used in the {@link sap.f.DynamicPage}, the {@link sap.f.DynamicPage}'s
   * `fitContent` property needs to be set to 'true' so that the scroll handling is left to the `sap.m.Wizard`
   * control. Also, in order to achieve the target Fiori design, the `sapUiNoContentPadding` class needs to
   * be added to the {@link sap.f.DynamicPage} as well as `sapUiResponsivePadding--header`, `sapUiResponsivePadding--content`
   * to the `sap.m.Wizard`.
