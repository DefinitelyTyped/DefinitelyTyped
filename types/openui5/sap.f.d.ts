   * Overview:
   *
   * The control allows you to display the avatars in different sizes, depending on your use case.

   *
   * Responsive Behavior:
   *
   * When the available space is less than the width required to display all avatars, an overflow visualization

   * displays the number of avatars that have overflowed and are not currently visible.

   *
   * A control that represents a container with a predefined header and content.
   *
   * Overview: The card is a container for grouping and displaying information.
   *
   * Structure: You can control the width and height of the card, using properties. The `Card` has the following
   * aggregations:
   * 	 - `header` - can be either a {@link sap.f.cards.Header Header} or a {@link sap.f.cards.NumericHeader
   * 			NumericHeader} `content` - can be any {@link sap.ui.core.Control Control}.
   *
   * Guidelines::
   * 	 - A card should represent a task or visualize a specific set of information.
   * 	 - It is recommended to use cards on home page layouts.
   * 	 - The card shouldn't be large with a lot of content.
   *
   * Usage: To show a KPI value or any numeric information, use {@link sap.f.cards.NumericHeader NumericHeader}
   * as a card header. For any other use cases, use the regular {@link sap.f.cards.Header Header}. Recommended
   * content: - List - Table - Object information - Charts - Timelines - Images
   *
   * When to use
   * 	 - When you need multiple cards on a home page layout.
   * 	 - When you have to achieve simple card visualization.
   *
   * When not to use
   * 	 - When you have to reuse the card between applications. For such cases, use: {@link sap.ui.integration.widgets.Card
   * 			Integration Card}.
   * 	 - When you need nesting. For such cases, use: {@link sap.m.Panel Panel}.
   * 	 - When the card is not part of a card layout. For such cases, use: {@link sap.m.Panel Panel}.
   * 	 - When you need more header configuration flexibility.

   * @SINCE 1.42
   *
   * A layout control, representing a web page, consisting of a title, header with dynamic behavior, a content
   * area, and an optional floating footer.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The control consist of several components:
   *
   *
   * 	 - {@link sap.f.DynamicPageTitle DynamicPageTitle} - consists of a heading on the left side, content
   * 			in the middle, and actions on the right. The displayed content changes based on the current mode of the
   * 			{@link sap.f.DynamicPageHeader DynamicPageHeader}.
   * 	 - {@link sap.f.DynamicPageHeader DynamicPageHeader} - a generic container, which can contain a single
   * 			layout control and does not care about the content alignment and responsiveness. The header works in
   * 			two modes - expanded and snapped and its behavior can be adjusted with the help of different properties.
   *
   * 	 - Content area - a generic container, which can have a single UI5 layout control and does not care
   * 			about the content alignment and responsiveness.
   * 	 - Footer - positioned at the bottom with a small offset and used for additional actions, the footer
   * 			floats above the content. It can be any {@link sap.m.IBar} control.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * Use the `DynamicPage` if you need to have a title, that is always visible and a header, that has configurable
   * Expanding/Snapping functionality. If you don't need the Expanding/Snapping functionality it is better
   * to use the {@link sap.m.Page} as a lighter control.
   *
   * **Notes:**
   * 	 - If you're displaying a {@link sap.m.FlexBox} with non-adaptive content (doesn't stretch to fill the
   * 			available space), it is recommended to set the `fitContainer` property of the {@link sap.m.FlexBox FlexBox}
   * 			to `false`.
   * 	 - If you are displaying a {@link sap.ui.table.Table}, keep in mind that it is non-adaptive and may
   * 			cause unpredicted behavior for the `DynamicPage` on smaller screen sizes, such as mobile.
   * 	 - Snapping of the {@link sap.f.DynamicPageTitle DynamicPageTitle} is not supported in the following
   * 			case: When the `DynamicPage` has a scroll bar, the control usually scrolls to the snapping point - the
   * 			point, where the {@link sap.f.DynamicPageHeader DynamicPageHeader} is scrolled out completely. However,
   * 			when there is a scroll bar, but not enough content to reach the snapping point, the snapping is not possible
   * 			using scrolling.
   * 	 - When using {@link sap.ui.layout.form.Form}, {@link sap.m.Panel}, {@link sap.m.Table} and {@link sap.m.List}

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.46
   *
   * Implements the master-detail-detail paradigm by displaying up to three pages in separate columns.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The control is logically similar to {@link sap.m.SplitContainer} with the difference that it capable
   * of handling three columns (referred to as `Begin`, `Mid` and `End`) rather than two (`Master`, `Detail`).
   * The width of the three columns is variable.
   *
   * There are several possible layouts that can be changed either with the control's API, or by the user
   * with the help of layout arrows.
   *
   * Internally the control makes use of three instances of {@link sap.m.NavContainer}, thus forming the three
   * columns.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * Use this control for applications that need to display several logical levels of related information
   * side by side (e.g. list of items, item, sub-item, etc.). The control is flexible in a sense that the
   * application can focus the user's attention on one particular column by making it larger or even fullscreen.
   *
   * The columns are accessible with the `beginColumnPages`, `midColumnPages` and `endColumnPages` aggregations.
   *
   * The relative sizes and the visibility of the three columns are determined based on the value of the {@link
   * sap.f.LayoutType layout} property.
   *
   * Changes to the layout due to user interaction are communicated to the app with the `stateChange` event.
   *
   * **Notes:**
   * 	 - To easily implement the recommended UX design of a `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout`-based app, you can
   * 			use the `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayoutSemanticHelper` class.
   * 	 - To facilitate the navigation and view loading, you can use the {@link sap.f.routing.Router}
   *
   * Responsive Behavior:
   *
   * The control automatically displays the maximum possible number of columns based on the device size and
   * current `layout`. The app does not need to take into consideration the current device/screen size, but
   * only to add content to the columns and change the value of the `layout` property.
   *
   * For detailed information, see {@link sap.f.LayoutType LayoutType} enumeration.

   *
   * Helper class, facilitating the implementation of the recommended UX design of a `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout`-based
   * app.
   *
   * **Note:** Using this class is not mandatory in order to build an app with `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout`,
   * but exists for convenience only.
   *
   * The usage of `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayoutSemanticHelper` revolves around two main methods:
   * 	 - `getCurrentUIState`Suggests which action buttons to show in each `sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayout` column,
   * 			based on the current control state (number and visibility of columns, layout, etc..)
   * 	 - `getNextUIState`Suggests which `layout` to use when navigating to another view level (e.g. from one
   * 			view to two views).
   *
   * Sample usage of the class:
   *
   *
   * ```javascript
   *
   *
   *  var helper = sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayoutSemanticHelper.getInstanceFor(myFlexibleColumnLayout);
   *  helper.getCurrentUIState();
   *  helper.getNextUIState(2);
   *  helper.getNextUIState(0);
   *
   * ```
   *
   *
   * Calling `getCurrentUIState()` will return information which action buttons (Close, FullScreen, ExitFullScreen)
   * must be currently shown in which column, according to UX guidelines, as well as to what layout clicking
   * them should lead.
   *
   * Calling `getNextUIState(2)` will return information about the expected layout and action buttons if the
   * application should display three views (master-detail-detail), based on the current state.
   *
   * Similarly, calling `getNextUIState(0)` will return information about the expected layout and action buttons
   * if the application should display the initial view only (master), based on the current state.
   *
   * For more information, see {@link sap.f.FlexibleColumnLayoutSemanticHelper#getCurrentUIState} and {@link

     * 			whether action buttons should be shown in the `mid` and `end` columns, and what value of the `layout`
     * 			property should be set upon clicking these buttons. Each of these objects has the following fields: `closeColumn,

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.65
   *
   * A layout container control used for aligning items with various sizes in a simple grid.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The control is used to align tiles, cards and other controls in configuration, such as a home page or
   * a dashboard. It represents a grid layout with specific row and column sizes, in which the items can take
   * any number of rows and columns.
   *
   * The number of columns and rows each item takes can be configured with the use of the `{@link sap.f.GridContainerItemLayoutData}`.
   *
   * All rows have the same height and all columns have the same width. Their sizes can be configured with
   * the use of the `layout` aggregation and `{@link sap.f.GridContainerSettings}`.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * When to use
   * 	 - For aligning home page and dashboard items like Tiles and Cards in a simple grid system with equally
   * 			sized rows and columns.
   *
   * When not to use
   * 	 - If a more complex layout grid system, where columns and rows may vary in size, is needed.
   *
   * Example::
   * ```javascript
   *
   * <f:GridContainer>
   * 	<f:layout>
   * 		<f:GridContainerSettings rowSize="5rem" columnSize="5rem" gap="1rem" />
   * 	</f:layout>
   * 	<f:layoutS>
   * 		<f:GridContainerSettings rowSize="4rem" columnSize="4rem" gap="0.5rem" />
   * 	</f:layoutS>
   * 	<f:items>
   * 		<GenericTile header="Sales Fulfillment">
   * 			<layoutData>
   * 				<f:GridContainerItemLayoutData rows="2" columns="2" />
   * 			</layoutData>
   * 		</GenericTile>
   * 		<w:Card manifest="url-to-manifest">
   * 			<w:layoutData>
   * 				<f:GridContainerItemLayoutData rows="6" columns="3" />
   * 			</w:layoutData>
   * 		</w:Card>
   * 		<Panel>
   * 			<layoutData>
   * 				<f:GridContainerItemLayoutData columns="4" />
   * 			</layoutData>
   * 			<Text text="Sales information" />
   * 		</Panel>
   * 	</f:items>
   * </f:GridContainer>
   * ```
   *
   *
   * Drag and drop:: Drag and drop is enabled for the `GridContainer` with enhanced visualization and interaction,
   * better suited for grid items. This is configured by using the `{@link sap.f.dnd.GridDropInfo}`.
   *
   * Similar to the `{@link sap.ui.core.dnd.DropInfo}`, `{@link sap.f.dnd.GridDropInfo}` has to be added to
   * the `dragDropConfig` aggregation, by using `{@link sap.ui.core.Element#addDragDropConfig}`.
   *
   * Both `{@link sap.ui.core.dnd.DropInfo}` and `{@link sap.f.dnd.GridDropInfo}` can be used to configure
   * drag and drop. The difference is that the `{@link sap.f.dnd.GridDropInfo}` will provide a drop indicator,
   * which mimics the size of the dragged item and shows the potential drop position inside the grid.
   *
   * Keyboard Navigation:: `GridContainer` provides support for two-dimensional keyboard navigation through
   * its contained controls. Navigating up/down or left/right using the arrow keys follows the configurable
   * two-dimensional grid mesh. This provides stable navigation paths in the cases when there are items of

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.60
   *
   * A list-based control with grid layout capabilities.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * The control is based on {@link sap.m.ListBase} and adds the flexibility to configure different grid layouts.
   * The layout used is based on the CSS display grid and the control has a default configuration.
   *
   * With `customLayout` aggregation it is possible to use:
   * 	 - Predefined simple grid layouts such as {@link sap.ui.layout.cssgrid.GridBoxLayout GridBoxLayout}
   *
   * 	 - Flexible grid layouts, such as {@link sap.ui.layout.cssgrid.GridBasicLayout GridBasicLayout} or {@link
   * 			sap.ui.layout.cssgrid.GridResponsiveLayout GridResponsiveLayout} which reveal the native-browser CSS
   * 			display grid APIs. For more information, see {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout
   * 			MDN web docs: CSS Grid Layout}
   *
   * Every item can override its size by specifying the number of columns and/or rows it will take in the
   * grid. This is done using {@link sap.ui.layout.cssgrid.GridItemLayoutData GridItemLayoutData}.
   *
   * For best visualization, items of type {@link sap.f.GridListItem sap.f.GridListItem} should be used inside
   * the `items` aggregation.
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * For general cases, use the default grid configuration of the `GridList`. For Box case (equal sized items),
   * use `customLayout` aggregation with {@link sap.ui.layout.cssgrid.GridBoxLayout GridBoxLayout} For Grids
   * which need different configurations based on available width, use `customLayout` aggregation with {@link
   * sap.ui.layout.cssgrid.GridResponsiveLayout GridResponsiveLayout} To set a specific position to an item
   * or define its dimensions in the grid, pass `layoutData` of type {@link sap.ui.layout.cssgrid.GridItemLayoutData
   * GridItemLayoutData}
   *
   * When to use
   * 	 - If {@link sap.m.ListBase} features are required and the items must be positioned in a grid layout
   *
   *
   * When not to use
   * 	If a list layout is required, use {@link sap.m.List} instead. If only the layout is required, use
   * {@link sap.ui.layout.cssgrid.CSSGrid} instead.
   *
   * Drag and drop:: Drag and drop is enabled for the `GridList` with enhanced visualization and interaction,
   * better suited for grid items. This is configured by using the `{@link sap.f.dnd.GridDropInfo}`.
   *
   * Similar to the `{@link sap.ui.core.dnd.DropInfo}`, `{@link sap.f.dnd.GridDropInfo}` has to be added to
   * the `dragDropConfig` aggregation, by using `{@link sap.ui.core.Element#addDragDropConfig}`.
   *
   * Both `{@link sap.ui.core.dnd.DropInfo}` and `{@link sap.f.dnd.GridDropInfo}` can be used to configure
   * drag and drop. The difference is that the `{@link sap.f.dnd.GridDropInfo}` will provide a drop indicator,
   * which mimics the size of the dragged item and shows the potential drop position inside the grid.
   *
   * Keyboard Navigation:: `GridList` provides support for two-dimensional keyboard navigation through its
   * contained controls. Navigating up/down or left/right using the arrow keys follows the configurable two-dimensional
   * grid mesh. This provides stable navigation paths in the cases when there are items of different sizes.
   * When the user presses an arrow key in a direction outward of the `GridList`, a `borderReached` event
   * will be fired. The implementation of the `borderReached` event allows the application developer to control
   * where the focus goes, and depending on the surrounding layout pass the focus to a specific place in a
   * neighboring `GridList` using the method {@link #focusItemByDirection}.

           * of it.
           *
           * **Example app structure:**
           *
           * We have a `rootView` that is returned by the `createContent` function of our `UIComponent`. This view
           * contains an `sap.m.App` control with the ID 'myApp'
           * ```javascript
           *
           *
           * <View xmlns="sap.m">
           *     <App id="myApp"/>
           * </View>
           *
           * ```
           *  an xml view called 'Detail'
           * ```javascript
           *
           *
           * <View xmlns="sap.m">
           *     <IconTabBar>
           *         <items>
           *             <IconTabFilter>
           *                 <!-- content of our first tab -->
           *             <IconTabFilter>
           *             <IconTabFilter id="mySecondTab">
           *                 <!-- nothing here, since we will lazy load this one with a target -->
           *             <IconTabFilter>
           *         </items>
           *     </IconTabBar>
           * </View>
           *
           * ```
           *  and a view called 'SecondTabContent', this one contains our content we want to have lazy loaded. Now
           * we need to create our `Targets` instance with a config matching our app:
           * ```javascript
           *
           *
           *     new Targets({
           *         //Creates our views except for root, we created this one before - when using a component you
           *         views: new Views(),
           *         config: {
           *             // all of our views have that type
           *             viewType: 'XML',
           *             // a reference to the app control in the rootView created by our UIComponent
           *             controlId: 'myApp',

           *             detail: {
           *                 viewName: 'Detail'
           *             },
           *             secondTabContent: {
           *                 // A reference to the detail target defined above
           *                 parent: 'detail',
           *                 // A reference to the second Tab container in the Detail view. Here the target does not look in the rootView, it looks in the Parent view (Detail).
           *                 controlId: 'mySecondTab',
           *                 // An IconTabFilter has an aggregation called content so we need to overwrite the pages set in the config as default.
           *                 controlAggregation: 'content',
           *                 // A view containing the content
           *                 viewName: 'SecondTabContent'
           *             }
           *         }
           *     });
           *
           * ```
           *
           *
           * Now, if we call ` oTargets.display("secondTabContent") `, 2 views will be created: Detail and SecondTabContent.
           * The 'Detail' view will be put into the pages aggregation of the App. And afterwards the 'SecondTabContent'
           * view will be put into the content Aggregation of the second IconTabFilter. So a parent will always be
           * created before the target referencing it.

  /**
   * @SINCE 1.46.0
   *
   * Provides enhanced functionality by internally aggregating {@link sap.f.DynamicPage} and contains controls
   * with semantic-specific meaning.
   *
   * Overview:
   *
   * Content specified in the `sap.f.semantic.SemanticPage` aggregations is automatically positioned in dedicated
   * sections of the title or the footer of the page, depending on the control's semantics.
   *
   * The actions in the `SemanticPage` title are grouped to text actions or icon actions. When an aggregation
   * is set, the actions appear in the following predefined order (from left to right):
   *
   * Text actions:
   * 	 - The main semantic text action - `titleMainAction`
   * 	 - Any custom text actions - `titleCustomTextActions`
   * 	 - The semantic text actions - `editAction`, `deleteAction`, `copyAction` and `addAction`
   *
   * Icon actions:
   * 	 - Any custom icon actions - `titleCustomIconActions`
   * 	 - The simple semantic icon actions - `favoriteAction` and `flagAction`
   * 	 - The share menu semantic icon actions as a drop-down list with the following order:
   * 	`sendEmailAction`
   * 	 - `discussInJamAction`
   * 	 - `shareInJamAction`
   * 	 - `sendMessageAction`
   * 	 - `printAction`
   * 	 - Any `customShareActions`
   * 	 - The navigation semantic actions - `fullScreenAction`, `exitFullScreenAction`, and `closeAction`
   *
   * The actions in the `SemanticPage` footer are positioned either on its left or right area and have the
   * following predefined order:
   *
   * Footer left area:
   * 	 - The semantic text action - `messagesIndicator`
   * 	 - The semantic label - `draftIndicator`
   *
   * Footer right area:
   * 	 - The main semantic text action - `footerMainAction`
   * 	 - The semantic text actions - `positiveAction` and `negativeAction`
   * 	 - Any custom text actions - `footerCustomActions`
   *
   * Usage:
   *
   * Using the `SemanticPage` facilitates the implementation of the SAP Fiori 2.0 design guidelines.
   *
   * Responsive behavior:
   *
   * The responsive behavior of the `SemanticPage` depends on the behavior of the content that is displayed.
   * To adjust the `SemanticPage` content padding, the `sapUiContentPadding`, `sapUiNoContentPadding`, and
   * `sapUiResponsiveContentPadding` CSS classes can be used.
