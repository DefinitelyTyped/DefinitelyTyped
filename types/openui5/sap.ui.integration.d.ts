  /**
   * @SINCE 1.62
   *
   * A control that represents a container with a header and content.
   *
   * Overview: Cards are small user interface elements which provide the most important information from an
   * app, related to a specific role or task. The information is represented in a compact manner, allowing
   * for actions to be executed. Cards can be described as small representations of an app which can be integrated
   * in different systems.
   *
   * The integration card is defined in a declarative way, using a manifest.json to be:
   * 	 - Easily integrated into apps
   * 	 - Easily reused across apps
   * 	 - Understandable by other technologies
   * 	 - Self-contained (has a built-in functionality and doesn't need external configuration)
   * 	 - Dynamic parameter handling
   * 	 - Clear separation of the roles of the card and app developers
   *
   * The role of the card developer is to describe the card in a manifest.json file and define:
   * 	 - Header
   * 	 - Content
   * 	 - Data source
   * 	 - Possible actions
   *
   * The role of the app developer is to integrate the card into the app and define:
   * 	 - The dimensions of the card inside a layout of choice, using the `width` and `height` properties
   * 	 - The behavior for the actions described in the manifest.json file, using the action event
   *
   * **You can learn more about integration cards in the {@link demo:sap/ui/integration/demokit/cardExplorer/index.html
   * Card Explorer}**
   *
   * When to use
   * 	 - When you want to reuse the card across apps.
   * 	 - When you need easy integration and configuration.
   *
   * When not to use
   * 	 - When you need more header and content flexibility.
   * 	 - When you have to achieve simple card visualization. For such cases, use: {@link sap.f.Card sap.f.Card}.
   *
   * 	 - When you have to use an application model. For such cases, use: {@link sap.f.Card sap.f.Card}.
   * 	 - When you need complex behavior. For such cases, use: {@link sap.f.Card sap.f.Card}.
