 * 4.  In Scriptables local folder. This folder is accessible from the Files app.
 *
 * You can specify a file path rather than the name of a file e.g. `importModule('/lib/foo')`. If the path points to a directory, Scriptable will look for a file named `index.js` in
 * the directory.
 *
 * The `importModule` function returns `module.exports` of the imported module.
 *
 * Consider the following file.
 *
 *     let circle = importModule('circle')
 *     let r = 2
 *     let area = circle.area(r)
 *     log('Area of circle: ' + area)
 *
 * The file imports the module `circle.js` which has the following contents.
 *
 *     module.exports.area = (r) => {
 *       return Math.PI * Math.pow(r, 2)
 *     }
 *
 *     module.exports.circumference = (r) => {
 *       return 2 * Math.PI * r
 *     }
 *
 * The `circle.js` module exports the functions `area` and `circumference`.
 *
 * For more information about modules, refer to the documentation on the `module` variable.
