// Type definitions for non-npm package MediaStreamTrack Insertable Media Processing using Streams 0.1
// Project: https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-transform/
// Definitions by: Ben Wagner <https://github.com/dogben>
// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped
// Minimum TypeScript Version: 3.9

// In general, these types are only available behind a command line flag or an origin trial in
// Chrome 90+.

// This API depends on WebCodecs.
/// <reference types="dom-webcodecs" />

// Versioning:
// Until the above-mentioned spec is finalized, the major version number is 0. Although not
// necessary for version 0, consider incrementing the minor version number for breaking changes.

// The following modify existing DOM types to allow defining type-safe APIs on audio and video tracks.

/** Specialize MediaStreamTrack so that we can refer specifically to an audio track. */
