     *   (not the sum of their sizes).

     * - When `encoding` is set to `buffer`, it collects an array of buffers.
     *   `maxBuffer` refers to the summed byte lengths of every buffer in the array.
     *
     * - When `encoding` is set to anything else, it collects an array of strings.
     *   `maxBuffer` refers to the summed character lengths of every string in the array.
