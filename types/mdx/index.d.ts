/**
 * An MDX file which exports a JSX component.
 *
 * By default MDX files export a single function which takes props and returns a JSX element.
 * However, MDX files may export more, either through ESM exports inside the MDX file, or using by
 * exports generated by plugins.
 *
 * To define exports for every MDX file in a project, create a TypeScript
 * [script](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/modules.html#non-modules) file which
 * augments `*.mdx`. A script file is a file which doesnâ€™t use top-level ESM syntax, but ESM syntax
 * us allowed inside the declared module. This is typically useful for exports created by plugins.
 * For example:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // mdx-custom.d.ts
 * declare module '*.mdx' {
 *   import { Frontmatter } from 'my-frontmatter-types';
 *
 *   export const frontmatter: Frontmatter;
 *   export const title: string;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To define additional types for specific MDX files, create a file named the same, but postfixed
 * with `.d.ts` next to the MDX file.
 *
 * For example, given the following MDX file `my-component.mdx`:
 *
 * ```mdx
 * export const hello = 'mdx';
 *
 * # Hello MDX
 * ```
 *
 * Create the following file named `my-component.mdx.d.ts` in the same directory:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export const hello: string;
 * ```
 *
 * It should now be possible to import both the MDX component and the exported constant `hello`.

declare module '*.mdx' {
    /**
     * An function component which renders the MDX content using JSX.
     *
     * @param props This value is be available as the named variable `props` inside the MDX component.
     * @returns A JSX element. The meaning of this may depend on the project configuration. I.e. it
     * could be a React, Preact, or Vuex element.
