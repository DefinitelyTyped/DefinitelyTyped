/**
 * Gesture recognition on mobile devices is much more complicated than web.
 * A touch can go through several phases as the app determines what the user's intention is.
 * For example, the app needs to determine if the touch is scrolling, sliding on a widget, or tapping.
 * This can even change during the duration of a touch. There can also be multiple simultaneous touches.
 *
 * The touch responder system is needed to allow components to negotiate these touch interactions
 * without any additional knowledge about their parent or child components.
 * This system is implemented in ResponderEventPlugin.js, which contains further details and documentation.
 *
 * Best Practices
 * Users can feel huge differences in the usability of web apps vs. native, and this is one of the big causes.
 * Every action should have the following attributes:
 *      Feedback/highlighting- show the user what is handling their touch, and what will happen when they release the gesture
 *      Cancel-ability- when making an action, the user should be able to abort it mid-touch by dragging their finger away
 *
 * These features make users more comfortable while using an app,
 * because it allows people to experiment and interact without fear of making mistakes.
 *
 * TouchableHighlight and Touchable*
 * The responder system can be complicated to use.
 * So we have provided an abstract Touchable implementation for things that should be "tappable".
 * This uses the responder system and allows you to easily configure tap interactions declaratively.
 * Use TouchableHighlight anywhere where you would use a button or link on web.
