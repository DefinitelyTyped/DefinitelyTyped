# Typescript definition for Gmail API library

# Usage

Install client library:

```
npm install @types/gapi.client --save-dev
```

Note: you need this package in order to use other `@types/gapi.client.*` packages.

Also, you **don't** need `@types/gapi` or `@types/gapi.auth2`. This packages has both typings included.
