    /**
     * Sets a callback for name - address translation.
     *
     * @remarks
     * This is optional - you can choose to use "addItem" etc with absolute addresses.
     *
     * If you use it, translator should be a function that takes a string as an argument, and returns a string in the
     * following format: `<data block number.><memory area><data type><byte offset><.array length>`
     *
     * Examples:
     *
     * - MR30 - MD30 as REAL
     * - DB10,LR32 - LREAL at byte offset 32 in DB10, for 1200/1500 only
     * - DB10,INT6 - DB10.DBW6 as INT
     * - DB10,I6 -same as above
     * - DB10,INT6.2 - DB10.DBW6 and DB10.DBW8 in an array with length 2
     * - PIW30 - PIW30 as INT
     * - DB10,S20.30 - String at offset 20 with length of 30 (actual array length 32 due to format of String type, length byte will be read/written)
     * - DB10,S20.30.3 - Array of 3 strings at offset 20, each with length of 30 (actual array length 32 due to format of String type, length byte will be read/written)
     * - DB10,C22.30 - Character array at offset 22 with length of 30 (best to not use this with strings as length byte is ignored)
     * - DB10,DT0 - Date and time
     * - DB10,DTZ0 - Date and time in UTC
     * - DB10,DTL0 - DTL in newer PLCs
     * - DB10,DTLZ0 - DTL in newer PLCs in UTC
     *
     * The DT type is the well-known DATE_AND_TIME type of S7-300/400 PLCs, a 8-byte-wide field with BCD-encoded parts
     *
     * The DTZ type is the same as the DT, but it expects that the timestamp is in UTC in the PLC (usually NOT the case)
     *
     * The DTL type is the one seen on newer S7-1200/1500 PLCs, is 12-byte long and encodes the timestamp differently
     * than the older DATE_AND_TIME
     *
     * The DTLZ type is also the same as the DTL, but expecting the timestamp in UTC in the PLC
     *
     * In the example above, an object is declared and the translator references that object. It could just as reference
     * a file or database. In any case, it allows cleaner Javascript code to be written that refers to a name instead of
     * an absolute address.
     * @param translator Function that converts names to address strings
