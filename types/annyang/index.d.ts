/**
 * Supported Events that will be triggered to listeners, you attach using `annyang.addCallback()`
 *
 * `start` - Fired as soon as the browser's Speech Recognition engine starts listening
 * `error` - Fired when the browser's Speech Recogntion engine returns an error, this generic error callback will be followed by more accurate error callbacks (both will fire if both are defined)
 * `errorNetwork` - Fired when Speech Recognition fails because of a network error
 * `errorPermissionBlocked` - Fired when the browser blocks the permission request to use Speech Recognition.
 * `errorPermissionDenied` - Fired when the user blocks the permission request to use Speech Recognition.
 * `end` - Fired when the browser's Speech Recognition engine stops
 * `result` - Fired as soon as some speech was identified. This generic callback will be followed by either the `resultMatch` or `resultNoMatch` callbacks.
 *     Callback functions registered to this event will include an array of possible phrases the user said as the first argument
 * `resultMatch` - Fired when annyang was able to match between what the user said and a registered command
 *     Callback functions registered to this event will include three arguments in the following order:
 *       * The phrase the user said that matched a command
 *       * The command that was matched
 *       * An array of possible alternative phrases the user might've said
 * `resultNoMatch` - Fired when what the user said didn't match any of the registered commands.
 *     Callback functions registered to this event will include an array of possible phrases the user might've said as the first argument
