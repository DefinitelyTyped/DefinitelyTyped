/**
 * Creates a plugin that enables the collaborative editing framework
 * for the editor.
 *
 *   config::- An optional set of options
 *
 *     version:: ?number
 *     The starting version number of the collaborative editing.
 *     Defaults to 0.
 *
 *     clientID:: ?union<number, string>
 *     This client's ID, used to distinguish its changes from those of
 *     other clients. Defaults to a random 32-bit number.

/**
 * Create a transaction that represents a set of new steps received from
 * the authority. Applying this transaction moves the state forward to
 * adjust to the authority's view of the document.
 *
 *   options::- Additional options.
 *
 *     mapSelectionBackward:: ?boolean
 *     When enabled (the default is `false`), if the current selection
 *     is a [text selection](#state.TextSelection), its sides are
 *     mapped with a negative bias for this transaction, so that
 *     content inserted at the cursor ends up after the cursor. Users
 *     usually prefer this, but it isn't done by default for reasons
 *     of backwards compatibility.
