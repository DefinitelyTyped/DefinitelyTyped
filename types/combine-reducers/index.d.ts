/**
 * these types are from the main redux type definitions:
 * https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/blob/master/index.d.ts
 */

/**
 * An *action* is a plain object that represents an intention to change the
 * state. Actions are the only way to get data into the store. Any data,
 * whether from UI events, network callbacks, or other sources such as
 * WebSockets needs to eventually be dispatched as actions.
 *
 * Actions must have a `type` field that indicates the type of action being
 * performed. Types can be defined as constants and imported from another
 * module. It's better to use strings for `type` than Symbols because strings
 * are serializable.
 *
 * Other than `type`, the structure of an action object is really up to you.
 * If you're interested, check out Flux Standard Action for recommendations on
 * how actions should be constructed.
 *
 * @template T the type of the action's `type` tag.
 */
export interface Action<T = any> {
    type: T;
}

/**
 * An Action type which accepts any other properties.
 * This is mainly for the use of the `Reducer` type.
 * This is not part of `Action` itself to prevent types that extend `Action` from
 * having an index signature.
 */
export interface AnyAction extends Action {
    // Allows any extra properties to be defined in an action.
    [extraProps: string]: any;
}

/* reducers */

/**
 * A *reducer* (also called a *reducing function*) is a function that accepts
 * an accumulation and a value and returns a new accumulation. They are used
 * to reduce a collection of values down to a single value
 *
 * Reducers are not unique to Redux—they are a fundamental concept in
 * functional programming.  Even most non-functional languages, like
 * JavaScript, have a built-in API for reducing. In JavaScript, it's
 * `Array.prototype.reduce()`.
 *
 * In Redux, the accumulated value is the state object, and the values being
 * accumulated are actions. Reducers calculate a new state given the previous
 * state and an action. They must be *pure functions*—functions that return
 * the exact same output for given inputs. They should also be free of
 * side-effects. This is what enables exciting features like hot reloading and
 * time travel.
 *
 * Reducers are the most important concept in Redux.
 *
 * *Do not put API calls into reducers.*
 *
 * @template S The type of state consumed and produced by this reducer.
 * @template A The type of actions the reducer can potentially respond to.
 */
export type Reducer<S = any, A extends Action = AnyAction> = (state: S | undefined, action: A) => S;

/**
 * Object whose values correspond to different reducer functions.
 *
 * @template A The type of actions the reducers can potentially respond to.
 */
export type ReducersMapObject<S = any, A extends Action = Action> = {
    [K in keyof S]: Reducer<S[K], A>;
};

/**
 * Turns an object whose values are different reducer functions, into a single
 * reducer function. It will call every child reducer, and gather their results
 * into a single state object, whose keys correspond to the keys of the passed
 * reducer functions.
 *
 * @template S Combined state object type.
 *
 * @param reducers An object whose values correspond to different reducer
 *   functions that need to be combined into one. One handy way to obtain it
 *   is to use ES6 `import * as reducers` syntax. The reducers may never
 *   return undefined for any action. Instead, they should return their
 *   initial state if the state passed to them was undefined, and the current
 *   state for any unrecognized action.
 *
 * @returns A reducer function that invokes every reducer inside the passed
 *   object, and builds a state object with the same shape.
