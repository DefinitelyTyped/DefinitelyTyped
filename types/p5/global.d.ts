   *   ranges.

   *   Perlin in the 1980s and been used since in
   *   graphical applications to produce procedural
   *   textures, natural motion, shapes, terrains etc.
   *   The main difference to the random() function is
   *   that Perlin noise is defined in an infinite
   *   n-dimensional space where each pair of coordinates
   *   corresponds to a fixed semi-random value (fixed
   *   only for the lifespan of the program; see the
   *   noiseSeed() function). p5.js can compute 1D, 2D
   *   and 3D noise, depending on the number of
   *   coordinates given. The resulting value will always
   *   be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be
   *   animated by moving through the noise space as
   *   demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd and 3rd
   *   dimension can also be interpreted as time.
   *
   *   The actual noise is structured similar to an audio
   *   signal, in respect to the function's use of
   *   frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics
   *   in physics, perlin noise is computed over several
   *   octaves which are added together for the final
   *   result.
   *
   *   Another way to adjust the character of the
   *   resulting sequence is the scale of the input
   *   coordinates. As the function works within an
   *   infinite space the value of the coordinates
   *   doesn't matter as such, only the distance between
   *   successive coordinates does (eg. when using
   *   noise() within a loop). As a general rule the
   *   smaller the difference between coordinates, the
   *   smoother the resulting noise sequence will be.
   *   Steps of 0.005-0.03 work best for most
   *   applications, but this will differ depending on
   *   use.

  /**
   *   Adjusts the character and level of detail produced

   *   output signal and as such define the overall
   *   intensity of the noise, whereas higher octaves
   *   create finer grained details in the noise
   *   sequence.  By default, noise is computed over 4
   *   octaves with each octave contributing exactly half
   *   than its predecessor, starting at 50% strength for
   *   the 1st octave. This falloff amount can be changed
