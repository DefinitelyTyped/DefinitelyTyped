     * derivation:
     *
     * =< ID '=' '(' INT ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
     * ^
     *
     * The attempt to match `')'` will fail when it sees `';'` and
     * call {@link recoverInline}. To recover, it sees that `LA(1)==';'`
     * is in the set of tokens that can follow the `')'` token reference

     * follow that rule reference on the stack; this amounts to
     * computing FIRST of what follows the rule reference in the
     * enclosing rule. See LinearApproximator.FIRST().
     * This local follow set only includes tokens
     * from within the rule; i.e., the FIRST computation done by
     * ANTLR stops at the end of a rule.
     *
     * EXAMPLE
     *
     * When you find a "no viable alt exception", the input is not
     * consistent with any of the alternatives for rule r. The best
     * thing to do is to consume tokens until you see something that
     * can legally follow a call to r//or* any rule that called r.
     * You don't want the exact set of viable next tokens because the
     * input might just be missing a token--you might consume the
     * rest of the input looking for one of the missing tokens.
     *
     * Consider grammar:
     *
     * a : '[' b ']'
     * | '(' b ')'
     * ;
     * b : c '^' INT ;
     * c : ID
     * | INT
     * ;
     *
     * At each rule invocation, the set of tokens that could follow
     * that rule is pushed on a stack. Here are the various
     * context-sensitive follow sets:
     *
     * FOLLOW(b1_in_a) = FIRST(']') = ']'
     * FOLLOW(b2_in_a) = FIRST(')') = ')'
     * FOLLOW(c_in_b) = FIRST('^') = '^'
     *
     * Upon erroneous input "[]", the call chain is
     *
     * a -> b -> c
     *
     * and, hence, the follow context stack is:
     *
     * depth follow set start of rule execution
     * 0 <EOF> a (from main())
     * 1 ']' b
     * 2 '^' c
     *
     * Notice that ')' is not included, because b would have to have
     * been called from a different context in rule a for ')' to be
     * included.
     *
     * For error recovery, we cannot consider FOLLOW(c)
     * (context-sensitive or otherwise). We need the combined set of
     * all context-sensitive FOLLOW sets--the set of all tokens that
     * could follow any reference in the call chain. We need to
     * resync to one of those tokens. Note that FOLLOW(c)='^' and if
     * we resync'd to that token, we'd consume until EOF. We need to
     * sync to context-sensitive FOLLOWs for a, b, and c: {']','^'}.
     * In this case, for input "[]", LA(1) is ']' and in the set, so we would
     * not consume anything. After printing an error, rule c would
     * return normally. Rule b would not find the required '^' though.
     * At this point, it gets a mismatched token error and throws an
     * exception (since LA(1) is not in the viable following token
     * set). The rule exception handler tries to recover, but finds
     * the same recovery set and doesn't consume anything. Rule b
     * exits normally returning to rule a. Now it finds the ']' (and
     * with the successful match exits errorRecovery mode).
     *
     * So, you can see that the parser walks up the call chain looking
     * for the token that was a member of the recovery set.
     *
     * Errors are not generated in errorRecovery mode.
     *
     * ANTLR's error recovery mechanism is based upon original ideas:
     *
     * "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" by Niklaus Wirth
     *
     * and
     *
     * "A note on error recovery in recursive descent parsers":
     * http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=947902.947905
     *
     * Later, Josef Grosch had some good ideas:
     *
     * "Efficient and Comfortable Error Recovery in Recursive Descent
     * Parsers":
     * ftp://www.cocolab.com/products/cocktail/doca4.ps/ell.ps.zip
     *
     * Like Grosch I implement context-sensitive FOLLOW sets that are combined
     * at run-time upon error to avoid overhead during parsing.
