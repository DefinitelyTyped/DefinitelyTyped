 *
 * - Weak context sensitivity: These are cases where full-context prediction
 * resolved an SLL conflict to a unique alternative which equalled the
 * minimum alternative of the SLL conflict.

 * - Strong (forced) context sensitivity: These are cases where the
 * full-context prediction resolved an SLL conflict to a unique alternative,
 * _and_ the minimum alternative of the SLL conflict was found to not be
 * a truly viable alternative. Two-stage parsing cannot be used for inputs where
