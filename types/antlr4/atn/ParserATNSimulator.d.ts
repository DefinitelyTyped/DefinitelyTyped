     *
     * - Evaluate the precedence predicates for each configuration using

     * - Remove all configurations which predict an alternative greater than

     *
     * - The closure block cannot contain any epsilon transitions which bypass
     * the body of the closure, so all states reachable via alternative 1 are
     * part of the precedence alternatives of the transformed left-recursive
     * rule.
     * - The "primary" portion of a left recursive rule cannot contain an
     * epsilon transition, so the only way an alternative other than 1 can exist
     * in a state that is also reachable via alternative 1 is by nesting calls
     * to the left-recursive rule, with the outer calls not being at the
     * preferred precedence level.
     *
     * The prediction context must be considered by this filter to address
     * situations like the following.
     *
     * ```
     * grammar TA;
     * prog: statement* EOF;
     * statement: letterA | statement letterA 'b' ;

     * reference `'a'` in `letterA` is reachable from the left edge
     * of both the primary and closure blocks of the left-recursive rule
     * `statement`. The prediction context associated with each of these
     * configurations distinguishes between them, and prevents the alternative
     * which stepped out to `prog` (and then back in to `statement`
     * from being eliminated by the filter.

     * s : (ID | ID ID?) ';' ;
     *
     * When the ATN simulation reaches the state before ';', it has a DFA
     * state that looks like: [12|1|[], 6|2|[], 12|2|[]]. Naturally
     * 12|1|[] and 12|2|[] conflict, but we cannot stop processing this node
     * because alternative to has another way to continue, via [6|2|[]].
     * The key is that we have a single state that has config's only associated
     * with a single alternative, 2, and crucially the state transitions
     * among the configurations are all non-epsilon transitions. That means
     * we don't consider any conflicts that include alternative 2. So, we

     * conflicting alts when there is an intersection with an alternative
     * associated with a single alt state in the state&rarr;config-list map.

     * stop working on this state. In the previous example, we're concerned
