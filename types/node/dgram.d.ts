         * is assigned a random port number and is bound to the "all interfaces" address

         * DNS errors or for determining when it is safe to reuse the `buf` object.
         * DNS lookups delay the time to send for at least one tick of the
         * Node.js event loop.
         *

         * passed as the first argument to the `callback`. If a `callback` is not given,
         * the error is emitted as an `'error'` event on the `socket` object.
