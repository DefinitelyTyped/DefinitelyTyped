/**
 * The name for a factory consists of a namespace and the name of a specific
 * type within that namespace, like `'service:session'`.

/**
 * A type registry for the DI system, which other participants in the DI system
 * can register themselves into with declaration merging. The contract for this
 * type is that its keys are the `Type` from a `FullName`, and each value for a
 * `Type` is another registry whose keys are the `Name` from a `FullName`. The
 * mechanic for providing a registry is [declaration merging][handbook].
 *
 * [handbook]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html
 *
 * For example, Ember's `@ember/service` module includes this set of definitions:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export default class Service extends EmberObject {}
 *
 * // For concrete singleton classes to be merged into.
 * interface Registry extends Record<string, Service> {}
 *
 * declare module '@ember/owner' {
 *   service: Registry;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Declarations of services can then include the registry:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Service from '@ember/service';
 *
 * export default class Session extends Service {
 *   login(username: string, password: string) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * declare module '@ember/service' {
 *   interface Registry {
 *     session: Session;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Then users of the `Owner` API will be able to do things like this with strong
 * type safety guarantees:
 *
 * ```ts
 * getOwner(this)?.lookup('service:session').login("hello", "1234abcd");
 * ```
 *
 * @internal
