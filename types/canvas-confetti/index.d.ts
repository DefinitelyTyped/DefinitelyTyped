/**
 * `confetti` takes a single optional object. When `window.Promise` is available, it will return a Promise to let you know when it is done.
 * When promises are not available (like in IE), it will return `null`. You can polyfill promises using any of the popular polyfills. You
 * can also provide a custom promise implementation to `confetti` through:
 *
 * ```
 *  const MyPromise = require('some-promise-lib');
 *  const confetti = require('canvas-confetti');
 *  confetti.Promise = MyPromise;
 * ```
 *
 * If you call `confetti` multiple times before it is done, it
 * will return the same promise every time. Internally, the same canvas element will be reused, continuing the existing animation with the
 * new confetti added. The promise returned by each call to `confetti` will resolve once all animations are done.
