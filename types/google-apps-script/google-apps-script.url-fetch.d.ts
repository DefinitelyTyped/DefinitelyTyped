    /**
     * Fetch resources and communicate with other hosts over the Internet.
     *
     * This service allows scripts to communicate with other applications or access other resources
     * on the web by fetching URLs. A script can use the URL Fetch service to issue HTTP and HTTPS
     * requests and receive responses. The URL Fetch service uses Google's network infrastructure for
     * efficiency and scaling purposes.
     *
     * Requests made using this service originate from a set pool of IP ranges. You can look up the full list of IP addresses
     * if you need to whitelist or approve these requests.
     *
     * This service requires the https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.external_request
     * scope. In most cases Apps Script automatically detects and includes the scopes a script needs,
     * but if you are setting your scopes
     * explicitly you must manually add this scope to use UrlFetchApp.
     * See also
