     * and typed arrays. The own enumerable properties of arguments objects are cloned as plain objects. An empty
     * object is returned for uncloneable values such as error objects, functions, DOM nodes, and WeakMaps.

     * @param value The value to clone.
     * @return Returns the cloned value.
