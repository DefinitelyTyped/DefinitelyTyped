             * NOTE: the `name` binding allows API services to override the binding
             * to use different resource name schemes, such as `users/&#42;/operations`. To
             * override the binding, API services can add a binding such as
             * `"/v1/{name=users/&#42;}/operations"` to their service configuration.
             * For backwards compatibility, the default name includes the operations
             * collection id, however overriding users must ensure the name binding
             * is the parent resource, without the operations collection id.
