# Type definitions for square-connect

This is an unofficial package of type definitions for [square-connect][1].
Initially, it was generated by [swagger-codegen][2] but currently it requires to be updated manually and takes a lot of time.
Hence, you may encounter typings update delays in contrast to the official library.

To keep me motivated you can [buy me a beer][6] ðŸ˜‰

# Installation

`npm i @types/square-connect`
> in @types/square-connect@3.x all API-v1 related typings were removed, if you need them - install @types/square-connect@2.x

# @todo

* Declare methods definition for missing classes (ex: `export class SomeApi {}`)
* Change `any`s in methods definitions (ex: `doSomething(...args: Array<any>)`) regarding the [docs][5]

# Contribution

If you are facing some issues or you have an idea how to improve typings - feel free to contribute or open an issue.

* Clone the [DefinitelyTyped][3] project
    * or update if you already have it (`git fetch upstream && git reset --hard upstream/master`)
* Add your changes and commit them (in case of error in [api.json][4] too, let the Square team know about it)
* Test your changes:
    * `npm run lint square-connect`
    * `npm run test`
