/**
 * FCL has a mechanism that lets you configure various aspects of FCL. The

 * one instance of the Flow Blockchain to another (Local Emulator to Testnet
 * to Mainnet) the only thing you should need to change (once again from an
 * FCL perspective) is your configuration.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as fcl from "@onflow/fcl"
 *
 * const configuration = fcl.config({
 *   "accessNode.api": "https://access-testnet.onflow.org",
 *   "discovery.wallet": "https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/testnet/authn",
 *   "0xProfile": "0xba1132bc08f82fe2"
 * });
 *
 * configuration.put('foo', 'bar');
 * configuration.get('foo').then(console.log); // â†µ "bar"
 * ```
 *
 * @param options - The initial configuration values.
