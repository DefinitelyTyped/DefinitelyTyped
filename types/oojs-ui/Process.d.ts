     * A Process is a list of steps that are called in sequence. The step can be a number, a
     * promise (jQuery, native, or any other “thenable”), or a function:
     *
     * - **number**: the process will wait for the specified number of milliseconds before proceeding.
     * - **promise**: the process will continue to the next step when the promise is successfully
     *  resolved or stop if the promise is rejected.
     * - **function**: the process will execute the function. The process will stop if the function
     *  returns either a boolean `false` or a promise that is rejected; if the function returns a
     *  number, the process will wait for that number of milliseconds before proceeding.
     *
     * If the process fails, an {@link OO.ui.Error error} is generated. Depending on how the error is
     * configured, users can dismiss the error and try the process again, or not. If a process is
     * stopped, its remaining steps will not be performed.
