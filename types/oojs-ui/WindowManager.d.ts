     * Window managers are used to open and close {@link OO.ui.Window windows} and control their
     * presentation. Managed windows are mutually exclusive. If a new window is opened while a current
     * window is opening or is opened, the current window will be closed and any on-going
     * {@link OO.ui.Process process} will be cancelled. Windows
     * themselves are persistent and—rather than being torn down when closed—can be repopulated with the
     * pertinent data and reused.
     *
     * Over the lifecycle of a window, the window manager makes available three promises: `opening`,
     * `opened`, and `closing`, which represent the primary stages of the cycle:
     *
     * **Opening**: the opening stage begins when the window manager’s {@link openWindow} or a window’s
     * {@link OO.ui.Window.open open} method is used, and the window manager begins to open the window.
     *
     * - an `opening` event is emitted with an `opening` promise
     * - the {@link getSetupDelay} method is called and the returned value is used to time a pause in execution
     *   before the window’s {@link OO.ui.Window.setup setup} method is called which executes
     *   {@link OO.ui.Window.getSetupProcess}.
     * - a `setup` progress notification is emitted from the `opening` promise
     * - the {@link getReadyDelay} method is called the returned value is used to time a pause in execution
     *   before the window’s {@link OO.ui.Window.ready ready} method is called which executes
     *   {@link OO.ui.Window.getReadyProcess}.
     * - a `ready` progress notification is emitted from the `opening` promise
     * - the `opening` promise is resolved with an `opened` promise
     *
     * **Opened**: the window is now open.
     *
     * **Closing**: the closing stage begins when the window manager's {@link closeWindow} or the
     * window's {@link OO.ui.Window.close close} methods is used, and the window manager begins
     * to close the window.
     *
     * - the `opened` promise is resolved with `closing` promise and a `closing` event is emitted
     * - the {@link getHoldDelay} method is called and the returned value is used to time a pause in execution
     *   before the window's {@link OO.ui.Window.getHoldProcess getHoldProcess} method is called on the
     *   window and its result executed
     * - a `hold` progress notification is emitted from the `closing` promise
     * - the {@link getTeardownDelay}() method is called and the returned value is used to time a pause in
     *   execution before the window's {@link OO.ui.Window.getTeardownProcess getTeardownProcess} method
     *   is called on the window and its result executed
     * - a `teardown` progress notification is emitted from the `closing` promise
     * - the `closing` promise is resolved. The window is now closed
     *

             * This function can be called in two manners:

             *
             *    This syntax registers windows under the symbolic names defined in their `.static.name`
             *    properties. For example, if `windowA.constructor.static.name` is `'nameA'`, calling
             *    `.openWindow( 'nameA' )` afterwards will open the window `windowA`. This syntax requires the
             *    static name to be set, otherwise an exception will be thrown.
             *
             *    This is the recommended way, as it allows for an easier switch to using a window factory.
             *
             * 2. `.addWindows( { nameA: winA, nameB: winB, ... } )`
             *
             *    This syntax registers windows under the explicitly given symbolic names. In this example,
             *    calling `.openWindow( 'nameA' )` afterwards will open the window `windowA`, regardless of what
             *    its `.static.name` is set to. The static name is not required to be set.
             *
             *    This should only be used if you need to override the default symbolic names.
             *
             * Example:
             *
             *     var windowManager = new OO.ui.WindowManager();
             *     $( document.body ).append( windowManager.$element );

             *     // Add a window under an explicit name
             *     windowManager.addWindows( { myMessageDialog: new OO.ui.MessageDialog() } );
             *

             *     // Open window by explicitly given name
             *     windowManager.openWindow( 'myMessageDialog' );
