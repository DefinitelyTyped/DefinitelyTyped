         * What this means is that this form is very efficient, particularly for large ranges, as the iteration through the set happens on the scheduler,
         * and one item at a time. When the range has { start:0, step:1 }, the returned promise is resolved with an array of resultant values.

         * These are used to create multidimensional ranges, like nested loops. If they were written as traditional loops,

         * Form 4: for (iterableObject, work, arguments)
         * Future Note - form4 with an ES6 functionjob argument presents the possibility where, in a future version of DCP,
         * the protocol will support extremely large input sets without transferring the sets to the scheduler in their entirety.
         * Since these are ES6 function generators, the scheduler could request blocks of data from the client even while the client is ‘blocked’ in an await call,
         * without altering the API. This means DCP could process, for example,
         * jobs where the input set is a very long list of video frames and each slice represents one frame.
