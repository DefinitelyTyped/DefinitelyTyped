    /**
     * ## Usage on the web
     *
     * To parse a document, you must create a new Readability object from a
     * DOM document object, and then call parse(). Here's an example:
     *
     * ```js
     * var article = new Readability(document).parse();
     * ```
     *
     * If you're using Readability on the web, you will likely be able to
     * use a document reference from elsewhere (e.g. fetched via XMLHttpRequest,
     * in a same-origin <iframe> you have access to, etc.).
     *
     * ## Usage from node.js
     *
     * In node.js, you won't generally have a DOM document object. To obtain one, you can use external
     * libraries like [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom). While this repository contains a parser of
     * its own (`JSDOMParser`), that is restricted to reading XML-compatible markup and therefore we do
     * not recommend it for general use.
     *
     * If you're using `jsdom` to create a DOM object, you should ensure that the page doesn't run (page)
     * scripts (avoid fetching remote resources etc.) as well as passing it the page's URI as the `url`
     * property of the `options` object you pass the `JSDOM` constructor.
     *
     * ```js
     * var JSDOM = require('jsdom').JSDOM;
     * var doc = new JSDOM("<body>Here's a bunch of text</body>", {
     *   url: "https://www.example.com/the-page-i-got-the-source-from",
     * });
     * let reader = new Readability(doc.window.document);
     * let article = reader.parse();
     * ```
     */
    constructor(doc: Document, options?: Readability.Options);

    /**
     * Runs readability.
     *
     * ## Workflow:
     *
     *  1. Prep the document by removing script tags, css, etc.
     *  2. Build readability's DOM tree.
     *  3. Grab the article content from the current dom tree.
     *  4. Replace the current DOM tree with the new one.
     *  5. Read peacefully.
     *
     * ## Additional notes:
     *
     * Readability's parse() works by modifying the DOM. This removes some
     * elements in the web page. You could avoid this by passing the clone
     * of the document object while creating a Readability object.
     *
     * ```js
     * var documentClone = document.cloneNode(true);
     * var article = new Readability(documentClone).parse();
     * ```
     *
     * The response will be null if the processing failed (https://github.com/mozilla/readability/blob/52ab9b5c8916c306a47b2119270dcdabebf9d203/Readability.js#L2038)
