 * Create a new middleware function to serve files from within a given root directory.
 * The file to serve will be determined by combining req.url with the provided root directory.
 * When a file is not found, instead of sending a 404 response, this module will instead call next() to move on to the next middleware, allowing for stacking and fall-backs.
