/**
 * Shuffle an array using `secure-random-uniform` as the RNG.
 *
 * Takes an array-like structure (eg. `Buffer`) and shuffles it. Note that the
 * original will be mutated for performance reasons. You might want to copy
 * the structure before passing it, depending on your use-case.
 *
 * As a convenience, the passed structure will be returned.
 *
 * @example
 * import secureShuffle = require('secure-shuffle')
 *
 * const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
 *
 * const sarr = secureShuffle(arr.slice(0)) // sarr is now a shuffled copy of arr
 *
 * secureShuffle(arr) // arr is now shuffled
