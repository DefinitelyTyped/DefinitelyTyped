     * for the connection. In other words, if the connection would time out after at least 4 hours of inactivity, the heartbeat
     * resets the timer so that the timeout will not occur until at least 4 hours after the most recent heartbeat (or query).
     *
     * The default value is 3600 seconds (one hour). The valid range of values is 900 - 3600. Because timeouts usually occur after
     * at least 4 hours, a heartbeat every 1 hour is normally sufficient to keep the connection alive. Heartbeat intervals of less
     * than 3600 seconds are rarely necessary or useful.
