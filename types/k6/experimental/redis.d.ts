/**
 * `Client` is a Redis client for interacting with a Redis server or cluster.
 *
 * This client provides a promise-based API, enabling asynchronous operations with the Redis server.
 * It supports a wide range of configurations, including single-node connections, cluster mode, and connections through Redis Sentinel.
 *
 * The client can be configured either by passing a `RedisClientOptions` object for fine-grained configuration,
 * or by using a `RedisConnectionURL` string for simpler setups.
 *
