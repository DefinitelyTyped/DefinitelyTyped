/**
 * Allows creating a union type by combining primitive types and literal types without sacrificing auto-completion in IDEs for the literal type part of the union.
 * Currently, when a union type of a primitive type is combined with literal types, TypeScript loses all information about the combined literals.
 * Thus, when such type is used in an IDE with autocompletion, no suggestions are made for the declared literals.
 * This type is a workaround for [Microsoft/TypeScript#29729](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/29729). It will be removed as soon as it's not needed anymore.
 * @example
 * ```
 * import type {LiteralUnion} from 'type-fest';
 * // Before
 * type Pet = 'dog' | 'cat' | string;
 * const pet: Pet = '';
 * // Start typing in your TypeScript-enabled IDE.
 * // You **will not** get auto-completion for `dog` and `cat` literals.
 * // After
 * type Pet2 = LiteralUnion<'dog' | 'cat', string>;
 * const pet: Pet2 = '';
 * // You **will** get auto-completion for `dog` and `cat` literals.
