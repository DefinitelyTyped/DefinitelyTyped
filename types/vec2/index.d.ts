/**
 * A generic library useful when you need to work with points/vectors in 2d space.
 * **Stuff to Note**: most of the Vec2's methods take a `returnNew` as the last parameter.
 * If passed a truthy value, a new vector will be returned to you.
 * Otherwise the operation will be applied to `this` and `this` will be returned.
 * Also, since `Infinity`and `NaN` are so insidious, this library will throw as soon as it detects either of these so you can take action to fix your data/algorithm.
