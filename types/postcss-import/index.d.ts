/**
 * This plugin can consume local files, node modules or web_modules. To resolve path of an `@import` rule, it can look into root directory (by default `process.cwd()`), `web_modules`, `node_modules`
 * or local modules. _When importing a module, it will look for `index.css` or file referenced in `package.json` in the `style` or `main` fields._ You can also provide manually multiples paths where
 * to look at.
 *
 * **Notes:**
 *
 * - **This plugin should probably be used as the first plugin of your list. This way, other plugins will work on the AST as if there were only a single file to process, and will probably work as you
 *   can expect**.
 * - This plugin works great with [postcss-url](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-url) plugin, which will allow you to adjust assets `url()` (or even inline them) after inlining imported files.
 * - In order to optimize output, **this plugin will only import a file once** on a given scope (root, media queryâ€¦). Tests are made from the path & the content of imported files (using a hash table).
 *   If this behavior is not what you want, look at `skipDuplicates` option
 * - **If you are looking for glob, or sass like imports (prefixed partials)**, please look at [postcss-easy-import](https://github.com/trysound/postcss-easy-import) (which use this plugin under the
 *   hood).
 * - Imports which are not modified (by `options.filter` or because they are remote imports) are moved to the top of the output.
 * - **This plugin attempts to follow the CSS `@import` spec**; `@import` statements must precede all other statements (besides `@charset`).
