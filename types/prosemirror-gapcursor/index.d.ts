 * near and arrow-key-motion past places that don't have a normally
 * selectable position nearby, and create a gap cursor selection for
 * them. The cursor is drawn as an element with class
 * `ProseMirror-gapcursor`. You can either include
 * `style/gapcursor.css` from the package's directory or add your own
 * styles to make it visible.
