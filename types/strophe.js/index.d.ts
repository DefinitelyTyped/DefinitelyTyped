             *    @param callback - The connect callback function.
             *    @param wait - The optional HTTPBIND wait value.  This is the
             *      time the server will wait before returning an empty result for
             *      a request.  The default setting of 60 seconds is recommended.
             *    @param hold - The optional HTTPBIND hold value.  This is the

             *      should almost always be set to 1 (the default).
             *    @param route - The optional route value.
             *    @param authcid - The optional alternative authentication identity
             *      (username) if intending to impersonate another user.
             *      When using the SASL-EXTERNAL authentication mechanism, for example

             *      certificate), set authcid to that same JID. See XEP-178 for more
             *      details.
             *    @param [disconnection_timeout=3000] - The optional disconnection timeout

             *
             *  This function adds a stanza handler to the connection.  The
             *  handler callback will be called for any stanza that matches
             *  the parameters.  Note that if multiple parameters are supplied,
             *  they must all match for the handler to be invoked.
             *
             *  The handler will receive the stanza that triggered it as its argument.
             *  *The handler should return true if it is to be invoked again;
             *  returning false will remove the handler after it returns.*
             *
             *  As a convenience, the ns parameters applies to the top level element
             *  and also any of its immediate children.  This is primarily to make
             *  matching /iq/query elements easy.
             *
             *  Options
             *  ~~~~~~~
             *  With the options argument, you can specify boolean flags that affect how
             *  matches are being done.
             *
             *  Currently two flags exist:
             *
             *  - matchBareFromJid:
             *      When set to true, the from parameter and the
             *      from attribute on the stanza will be matched as bare JIDs instead
             *      of full JIDs. To use this, pass {matchBareFromJid: true} as the
             *      value of options. The default value for matchBareFromJid is false.
             *
             *  - ignoreNamespaceFragment:
             *      When set to true, a fragment specified on the stanza's namespace
             *      URL will be ignored when it's matched with the one configured for
             *      the handler.
             *
             *      This means that if you register like this:
             *      >   connection.addHandler(
             *      >       handler,
             *      >       'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc',
             *      >       null, null, null, null,
             *      >       {'ignoreNamespaceFragment': true}
             *      >   );
             *
             *      Then a stanza with XML namespace of
             *      'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc#user' will also be matched. If
             *      'ignoreNamespaceFragment' is false, then only stanzas with
             *      'http://jabber.org/protocol/muc' will be matched.
             *
             *  Deleting the handler
             *  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
             *  The return value should be saved if you wish to remove the handler
             *  with deleteHandler().
             *
             *  Parameters:
             *    @param handler - The user callback.
             *    @param ns - The namespace to match.
