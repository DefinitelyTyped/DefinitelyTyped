        *
        * - An Office Add-in task pane can have only one dialog box open at any time. Multiple dialogs can be open at the same time from Add-in 
        * Commands (custom ribbon buttons or menu items).
        *
        * - Every dialog box can be moved and resized by the user.
        *
        * - Every dialog box is centered on the screen when opened.
        *
        * - Dialog boxes appear on top of the host application and in the order in which they were created.
        *
        * Use a dialog box to:
        *
        * - Display authentication pages to collect user credentials.
        *
        * - Display an error/progress/input screen from a ShowTaskpane or ExecuteAction command.
        *
        * - Temporarily increase the surface area that a user has available to complete a task.
        *
        * Do not use a dialog box to interact with a document. Use a task pane instead.
        * 
        * For a design pattern that you can use to create a dialog box, see 
        * {@link https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/Client_Dialog.md | Client Dialog}  in the Office 
        * Add-in UX Design Patterns repository on GitHub.

         * @param data The data to be set. Either a string or  {@link Office.CoercionType} value, 2d array or TableData object.
         * 
         * If the value passed for `data` is:
         * 
         * - A string: Plain text or anything that can be coerced to a string will be inserted. 
         * In Excel, you can also specify data as a valid formula to add that formula to the selected cell. For example, setting data to "=SUM(A1:A5)" 
         * will total the values in the specified range. However, when you set a formula on the bound cell, after doing so, you can't read the added 
         * formula (or any pre-existing formula) from the bound cell. If you call the Document.getSelectedDataAsync method on the selected cell to 
         * read its data, the method can return only the data displayed in the cell (the formula's result).
         * 
         * - An array of arrays ("matrix"): Tabular data without headers will be inserted. For example, to write data to three rows in two columns, 
         * you can pass an array like this: [["R1C1", "R1C2"], ["R2C1", "R2C2"], ["R3C1", "R3C2"]]. To write a single column of three rows, pass an 
         * array like this: [["R1C1"], ["R2C1"], ["R3C1"]]
         * 
         * In Excel, you can also specify data as an array of arrays that contains valid formulas to add them to the selected cells. For example if no 
         * other data will be overwritten, setting data to [["=SUM(A1:A5)","=AVERAGE(A1:A5)"]] will add those two formulas to the selection. Just as 
         * when setting a formula on a single cell as "text", you can't read the added formulas (or any pre-existing formulas) after they have been 
         * set - you can only read the formulas' results.
         * 
         * - A TableData object: A table with headers will be inserted.
         * In Excel, if you specify formulas in the TableData object you pass for the data parameter, you might not get the results you expect due to 
         * the "calculated columns" feature of Excel, which automatically duplicates formulas within a column. To work around this when you want to 
         * write `data` that contains formulas to a selected table, try specifying the data as an array of arrays (instead of a TableData object), and 
         * specify the coercionType as Microsoft.Office.Matrix or "matrix".
         * 
         * @param options Provides options for how to insert data to the selection.
         * @param callback Optional. A function that is invoked when the callback returns, whose only parameter is of type {@link Office.AsyncResult}.
         *                  The AsyncResult.value property always returns undefined because there is no object or data to retrieve.

         * Setting formatting with the optional parameters of the `Document.setSelectedDataAsync` and `TableBinding.setDataAsync` methods only works 
         * to set formatting when writing data the first time. 
         * To make formatting changes after writing data, use the following methods:
         * 
         *  - To update cell formatting, such as font color and style, use the `TableBinding.setFormatsAsync` method (this method).
         * 
         *  - To update table options, such as banded rows and filter buttons, use the `TableBinding.setTableOptions` method.
         * 
         *  - To clear formatting, use the `TableBinding.clearFormats` method.
