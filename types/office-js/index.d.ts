         * 
         * @param data The data to be set. Either a string or  {@link Office.CoercionType} value, 2d array or TableData object.
         * 
         * If the value passed for `data` is:
         * 
         * - A string: Plain text or anything that can be coerced to a string will be inserted. 
         * In Excel, you can also specify data as a valid formula to add that formula to the selected cell. For example, setting data to "=SUM(A1:A5)" 
         * will total the values in the specified range. However, when you set a formula on the bound cell, after doing so, you can't read the added 
         * formula (or any pre-existing formula) from the bound cell. If you call the Document.getSelectedDataAsync method on the selected cell to 
         * read its data, the method can return only the data displayed in the cell (the formula's result).
         * 
         * - An array of arrays ("matrix"): Tabular data without headers will be inserted. For example, to write data to three rows in two columns, 
         * you can pass an array like this: [["R1C1", "R1C2"], ["R2C1", "R2C2"], ["R3C1", "R3C2"]]. To write a single column of three rows, pass an 
         * array like this: [["R1C1"], ["R2C1"], ["R3C1"]]
         * 
         * In Excel, you can also specify data as an array of arrays that contains valid formulas to add them to the selected cells. For example if no 
         * other data will be overwritten, setting data to [["=SUM(A1:A5)","=AVERAGE(A1:A5)"]] will add those two formulas to the selection. Just as 
         * when setting a formula on a single cell as "text", you can't read the added formulas (or any pre-existing formulas) after they have been 
         * set - you can only read the formulas' results.
         * 
         * - A TableData object: A table with headers will be inserted.
         * In Excel, if you specify formulas in the TableData object you pass for the data parameter, you might not get the results you expect due to 
         * the "calculated columns" feature of Excel, which automatically duplicates formulas within a column. To work around this when you want to 
         * write `data` that contains formulas to a selected table, try specifying the data as an array of arrays (instead of a TableData object), and 
         * specify the coercionType as Microsoft.Office.Matrix or "matrix". However, this technique will block the "calculated columns" feature only 
         * when one of the following conditions is met: (1) you are writing to all the cells of the column, or (2) there are already at least two 
         * different formulas in the column.
         * 
         * @param options Provides options for how to insert data to the selection.
         * @param callback Optional. A function that is invoked when the callback returns, whose only parameter is of type {@link Office.AsyncResult}.
         *                  The AsyncResult.value property always returns undefined because there is no object or data to retrieve.

         * 
         * 
         * @param data The data to be set. Either a string or  {@link Office.CoercionType} value, 2d array or TableData object.
         * 
         * If the value passed for `data` is:
         * 
         * - A string: Plain text or anything that can be coerced to a string will be inserted. 
         * In Excel, you can also specify data as a valid formula to add that formula to the selected cell. For example, setting data to "=SUM(A1:A5)" 
         * will total the values in the specified range. However, when you set a formula on the bound cell, after doing so, you can't read the added 
         * formula (or any pre-existing formula) from the bound cell. If you call the Document.getSelectedDataAsync method on the selected cell to 
         * read its data, the method can return only the data displayed in the cell (the formula's result).
         * 
         * - An array of arrays ("matrix"): Tabular data without headers will be inserted. For example, to write data to three rows in two columns, 
         * you can pass an array like this: [["R1C1", "R1C2"], ["R2C1", "R2C2"], ["R3C1", "R3C2"]]. To write a single column of three rows, pass an 
         * array like this: [["R1C1"], ["R2C1"], ["R3C1"]]
         * 
         * In Excel, you can also specify data as an array of arrays that contains valid formulas to add them to the selected cells. For example if no 
         * other data will be overwritten, setting data to [["=SUM(A1:A5)","=AVERAGE(A1:A5)"]] will add those two formulas to the selection. Just as 
         * when setting a formula on a single cell as "text", you can't read the added formulas (or any pre-existing formulas) after they have been 
         * set - you can only read the formulas' results.
         * 
         * - A TableData object: A table with headers will be inserted.
         * In Excel, if you specify formulas in the TableData object you pass for the data parameter, you might not get the results you expect due to 
         * the "calculated columns" feature of Excel, which automatically duplicates formulas within a column. To work around this when you want to 
         * write `data` that contains formulas to a selected table, try specifying the data as an array of arrays (instead of a TableData object), and 
         * specify the coercionType as Microsoft.Office.Matrix or "matrix". However, this technique will block the "calculated columns" feature only 
         * when one of the following conditions is met: (1) you are writing to all the cells of the column, or (2) there are already at least two 
         * different formulas in the column.
         * 
         * @param callback Optional. A function that is invoked when the callback returns, whose only parameter is of type {@link Office.AsyncResult}.
         *                  The AsyncResult.value property always returns undefined because there is no object or data to retrieve.

         * In these cases, add-ins should use REST APIs to access the user's mailbox instead.
         *
         * The `makeEwsRequestAsync` method sends an EWS request on behalf of the add-in to Exchange.
         *
         * You cannot request Folder Associated Items with the `makeEwsRequestAsync` method.

         *
         * Your add-in must have the `ReadWriteMailbox` permission to use the `makeEwsRequestAsync` method.

         * If the result exceeds 1 MB in size, an error message is returned instead.
         *
         * **Note**: This method is not supported in the following scenarios:
         * 
         * - In Outlook on iOS or Android.
         * 
         * - When the add-in is loaded in a Gmail mailbox.
         *
         * **Note**: The server administrator must set `OAuthAuthentication` to `true` on the Client Access Server EWS directory to enable the 
         * `makeEwsRequestAsync` method to make EWS requests.
         *
         * *Version differences*
         *
         * When you use the `makeEwsRequestAsync` method in mail apps running in Outlook versions earlier than version 15.0.4535.1004, you should set 
         * the encoding value to ISO-8859-1.
         *
         * `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1"?>`
         *
         * You do not need to set the encoding value when your mail app is running in Outlook on the web.
         * You can determine whether your mail app is running in Outlook or Outlook on the web by using the `mailbox.diagnostics.hostName` property.
         * You can determine what version of Outlook is running by using the `mailbox.diagnostics.hostVersion` property.

     * @param contextObject - A previously-created Visio.RequestContext. This context will get re-used by the batch function (instead of having a new context created). This means that the batch will be able to pick up changes made to existing API objects, if those objects were derived from this same context.
     * @param batch - A function that takes in a RequestContext and returns a promise (typically, just the result of "context.sync()"). The context parameter facilitates requests to the Visio application. Since the Office add-in and the Visio application run in two different processes, the RequestContext is required to get access to the Visio object model from the add-in.
