    options object, and pops up a widget that allows the user to select a completion. Finding hints is done with
    a hinting functions (the hint option), which is a function that take an editor instance and options object,
    and return a {list, from, to} object, where list is an array of strings or objects (the completions), and
    from and to give the start and end of the token that is being completed as {line, ch} objects. An optional
    selectedHint property (an integer) can be added to the completion object to control the initially selected hint. */
