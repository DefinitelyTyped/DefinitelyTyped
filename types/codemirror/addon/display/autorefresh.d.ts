         * This addon can be useful when initializing an editor in a hidden DOM node, in cases where it is difficult
         * to call refresh when the editor becomes visible. It defines an option autoRefresh which you can set to true
         * to ensure that, if the editor wasn't visible on initialization, it will be refreshed the first time it becomes
         * visible. This is done by polling every 250 milliseconds (you can pass a value like {delay: 500} as the option
         * value to configure this). Note that this addon will only refresh the editor once when it first becomes visible,
         * and won't take care of further restyling and resizing.
