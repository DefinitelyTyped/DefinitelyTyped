  title: Advertising Statistics API
  version: v1.0 latest
  description: |
    # Overview
    **Note**: The following documentation applies to the current API version; aspects of the domain and functionality are subject to change for general release.

    The Statistics API is an HTTP interface that allows advertisers to retrieve acquisition statistics data in CSV format.

    ## SKAdNetwork conversion
    The Stats API now allows advertisers to start to receive SKadNetwork conversion value data. This supports using SKAd conversion values:

    * as a splitBy dimension as skadConversionValue.
    * as a filter via the skadConversionValues parameter.

    This functionality is in addition to the recently launched SKAdNetwork install reporting. It's provided to assist advertisers who wish to test the new SKAdNetwork conversion values throughout March 2021, to prepare for Apple's anticipated roll-out of the Apple ATT for iOS14.

    ## Contact
    If you have any questions or feedback regarding the API you can reach out to us at unityads-support@unity3d.com.

    ## Change Log
    * August 2, 2021: First draft of the version 1 of the Unity Advertising Statistics API.


    # Authentication
    Using the Unity Ads Statistics API requires an API key token. You can generate an API key token from <a href="https://acquire.dashboard.unity3d.com/">dashboard</a> by selecting **Settings** from the left navigation bar.

    **Note**: The API key is generated for an specific username. If that username is removed from the organization, that API key will be automatically revoked. Please be aware of this if you use the API key as part of an integration with a 3rd party or any other business intelligence solution.
    
    You can use the key token in two ways:
    1. Place the key token in the GET request URL `apikey` parameter. For example:
    ```
    https://stats.unityads.unity3d.com/organizations/:organization_id/reports/acquisitions?apikey=<token>
    ```

    2. Place the key token in the `Authorization` header of the GET request, prefixed with `Bearer`. For example:
    ```
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://stats.unityads.unity3d.com/organizations/:organization_id/reports/acquisitions
    ```

    # Rate Limits
    The API has rate limiting in place. The rate limit is 1 request every 3 seconds per IP address.

        **Notes**:
          - SKAd specific fields are not available by default in the response and therefore should be explicitly specified in the fields parameter if required.
          - In addition, fields above will not be available for the creativePack, adType and osVersion filters since we do not get this granularity of data within the SKAd postbacks.

          CSV response of Acquisitions Report endpoint.

          The data returns in CSV format, with the following delimiters:
            - Commas (`,`) separate fields.
            - Periods (`.`) indicate decimals.
            - Double quotes (`" "`) indicate text fields.
            - The newline character separates lines within a field.

          #### Split data

          Split `campaignSet` data results in two fields:
            - campaign set id
            - campaign set name

          Split `campaign` data results in two fields:
            - campaign id
            - campaign name

          Split `creativePack` data results in two fields:
            - creative pack id
            - creative pack name

          Split `target` data results in three fields:
            - target id
            - target store id
            - target name


          **Note**: Splitting data by too many dimensions may impact response times for querying the API.
          To avoid lagging or timeouts, we recommend querying 1 day of data at a time when splitting by `sourceAppId` and `country`.
