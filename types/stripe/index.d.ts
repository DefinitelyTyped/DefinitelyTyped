             * By default, we prorate subscription changes. For example, if a customer signs up on May 1 for a $10 plan, she'll be billed
             * $10 immediately. If she then switches to a $20 plan on May 15, on June 1 she'll be billed $25 ($20 for a renewal of her
             * subscription and a $5 prorating adjustment for the previous month). Similarly, a downgrade will generate a credit to be
             * applied to the next invoice. We also prorate when you make quantity changes. Switching plans does not change the billing
             * date or generate an immediate charge unless you're switching between different intervals (e.g. monthly to yearly), in which
             * case we apply a credit for the time unused on the old plan and charge for the new plan starting right away, resetting the
             * billing date. (Note that if we charge for the new plan, and that payment fails, the plan change will not go into effect). If
             * you'd like to charge for an upgrade immediately, just pass prorate as true as usual, and then invoice the customer as soon
             * as you make the subscription change. That'll collect the proration adjustments into a new invoice, and Stripe will automatically
             * attempt to pay the invoice. If you don't want to prorate at all, set the prorate option to false and the customer would be billed
             * $10 on May 1 and $20 on June 1. Similarly, if you set prorate to false when switching between different billing intervals
             * (monthly to yearly, for example), we won't generate any credits for the old subscription's unused time, although we will still

     * and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Stripe's servers. Not all errors map cleanly onto HTTP

     * 401 - Unauthorized                 No valid API key provided.
