declare module 'leadfoot/Command' {
    import Element = require('leadfoot/Element');
    import Promise = require('dojo/promise/Promise');
    import Thenable = require('dojo/promise/Thenable');
    import Session = require('leadfoot/Session');

    /**
    * The Command class is a chainable, subclassable object type that can be used to execute commands serially against a
    * remote WebDriver environment. The standard Command class includes methods from the {@link module:leadfoot/Session}
    * and {@link module:leadfoot/Element} classes, so you can perform all standard session and element operations that
    * come with Leadfoot without being forced to author long promise chains.
    *
    * In order to use the Command class, you first need to pass it a {@link module:leadfoot/Session} instance for it to
    * use:
    *
    * ```js
    * var command = new Command(session);
    * ```
    *
    * Once you have created the Command, you can then start chaining methods, and they will execute in order one after
    * another:
    *
    * ```js
    * command.get('http://example.com')
    *   .findByTagName('h1')
    *   .getVisibleText()
    *   .then(function (text) {
    *       assert.strictEqual(text, 'Example Domain');
    *   });
    * ```
    *
    * Because these operations are asynchronous, you need to use a `then` callback in order to retrieve the value from the
    * last method. Command objects are Thenables, which means that they can be used with any Promises/A+ or ES6-confirmant
    * Promises implementation, though there are some specific differences in the arguments and context that are provided
    * to callbacks; see {@link module:leadfoot/Command#then} for more details.
    *
    * ---
    *
    * Each call on a Command generates a new Command object, which means that certain operations can be parallelised:
    *
    * ```js
    * command = command.get('http://example.com');
    * Promise.all([
    *   command.getPageTitle(),
    *   command.findByTagName('h1').getVisibleText()
    * ]).then(function (results) {
    *   assert.strictEqual(results[0], results[1]);
    * });
    * ```
    *
    * In this example, the commands on line 3 and 4 both depend upon the `get` call completing successfully but are
    * otherwise independent of each other and so execute here in parallel. This is different from commands in Intern 1
    * which were always chained onto the last called method within a given test.
    *
    * ---
    *
    * Command objects actually encapsulate two different types of interaction: *session* interactions, which operate
    * against the entire browser session, and *element* interactions, which operate against specific elements taken from
    * the currently loaded page. Things like navigating the browser, moving the mouse cursor, and executing scripts are
    * session interactions; things like getting text displayed on the page, typing into form fields, and getting element
    * attributes are element interactions.
    *
    * Session interactions can be performed at any time, from any Command. On the other hand, to perform element
    * interactions, you first need to retrieve one or more elements to interact with. This can be done using any of the
    * `find` or `findAll` methods, by the `getActiveElement` method, or by returning elements from `execute` or
    * `executeAsync` calls. The retrieved elements are stored internally as the *element context* of all chained
    * Commands. When an element method is called on a chained Command with a single element context, the result will be
    * returned as-is:
    *
    * ```js
    * command = command.get('http://example.com')
    *   // finds one element -> single element context
    *   .findByTagName('h1')
    *   .getVisibleText()
    *   .then(function (text) {
    *     // `text` is the text from the element context
    *     assert.strictEqual(text, 'Example Domain');
    *   });
    * ```
    *
    * When an element method is called on a chained Command with a multiple element context, the result will be returned
    * as an array:
    *
    * ```js
    * command = command.get('http://example.com')
    *   // finds multiple elements -> multiple element context
    *   .findAllByTagName('p')
    *   .getVisibleText()
    *   .then(function (texts) {
    *     // `texts` is an array of text from each of the `p` elements
    *     assert.deepEqual(texts, [
    *       'This domain is established to be used for [â€¦]',
    *       'More information...'
    *     ]);
    *   });
    * ```
    *
    * The `find` and `findAll` methods are special and change their behaviour based on the current element filtering state
    * of a given command. If a command has been filtered by element, the `find` and `findAll` commands will only find
    * elements *within* the currently filtered set of elements. Otherwise, they will find elements throughout the page.
    *
    * Some method names, like `click`, are identical for both Session and Element APIs; in this case, the element APIs
    * are suffixed with the word `Element` in order to identify them uniquely.
    *
    * ---
    *
    * Commands can be subclassed in order to add additional functionality without making direct modifications to the
    * default Command prototype that might break other parts of the system:
    *
    * ```js
    * function CustomCommand() {
    *   Command.apply(this, arguments);
    * }
    * CustomCommand.prototype = Object.create(Command.prototype);
    * CustomCommand.prototype.constructor = CustomCommand;
    * CustomCommand.prototype.login = function (username, password) {
    *   return new this.constructor(this, function () {
    *     return this.parent
    *       .findById('username')
    *         .click()
    *         .type(username)
    *         .end()
    *       .findById('password')
    *         .click()
    *         .type(password)
    *         .end()
    *       .findById('login')
    *         .click()
    *         .end();
    *   });
    * };
    * ```
    *
    * Note that returning `this`, or a command chain starting from `this`, from a callback or command initialiser will
    * deadlock the Command, as it waits for itself to settle before settling.
