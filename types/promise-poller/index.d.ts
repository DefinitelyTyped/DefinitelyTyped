   * ## Basic usage
   * The core of `promise-poller` is a *task function*. This is simply a
   * function that starts your asynchronous task and returns a promise. If the
   * task function does not return a promise, it will be wrapped in a promise.
   * To start polling, pass your task function to the `promisePoller`
   * function, using this option.
   *
   * ## Cancel polling
   * You may want to cancel the polling early. For example, if the poll fails
   * because of an invalid password, that's not likely to change, so it would
   * be a waste of time to continue to poll. To cancel polling early, return
   * `false` from the task function instead of a promise.

   * If the poll attempt failed, and you want to abort further polling, return
   * `false` from this function. On the other hand, if your poll resolved to a
   * value but you want to keep polling, return `true` from this function.
   *
   * @param reason a rejection reason when a poll fails
   * @param value the resolved value when a poll succeeds

  /**
   * ## Select polling strategy
   * By default, `promise-poller` will use a fixed interval between each poll
   * attempt. For example, with an `interval` option of 500, the poller will
   * poll approximately every 500 milliseconds. This is the `fixed-interval`
   * strategy. There are two other strategies available that may better suit
   * your use case. To select a polling strategy, specify the `strategy`
   * option, e.g.:
   *
   *     promisePoller({
   *       taskFn: myTask,
   *       strategy: 'linear-backoff'
   *     });
   *
   * ### Linear backoff (`linear-backoff`)
   * Options: `start`, `increment`
   *
   * Linear backoff will increase the interval linearly by some constant
   * amount for each poll attempt. For example, using the default options, the
   * first retry will wait 1000 milliseconds. Each successive retry will wait
   * an additional 1000 milliseconds: 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, etc.
   *
   * ### Exponential backoff with jitter (`exponential-backoff`)
   * Options: `min`, `max`
   *
   * Exponential backoff increases the poll interval by a power of two for
   * each poll attempt. `promise-poller` uses exponential backoff with jitter.
   * Jitter takes a random value between `min` and 2^*n* on the *n*th polling
   * interval, not to exceed `max`.
   *
   * For more information about exponential backoff with jitter, and its
   * advantages, see
   * [this blog post from the AWS team](https://www.awsarchitectureblog.com/2015/03/backoff.html).

   * ## Progress notification
   * You can also specify a progress callback function. Each time the task
   * fails, the progress callback will be called with the number of retries
   * remaining and the error that occurred (the value that the task promise
   * was rejected with)
   */

  /**
   * ## Debugging
   * `promise-poller` uses the [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug)
   * library. The debug name is `promisePoller`. To run your program with
   * debug output for the `promise-poller`, set the `DEBUG` environment
   * variable accordingly:
   *
   * `% DEBUG=promisePoller node path/to/app.js`
   *
   * If you have more than one poller active at a time, and you need to
   * differentiate between them in debug output, you can give the
   * `promisePoller` options a `name` property.
   *
   * When this poller prints debug messages, the poller name will be included:
   * ```text
   * promisePoller (App Server Poller) Poll failed. 1 retries remaining. +504ms
   * ```
   * @example 'App Server Poller'
