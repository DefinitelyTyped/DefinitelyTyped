     Note that validation is performed in order (i.e. headers, params, query, and payload) and if type casting is used (e.g. converting a string to a number), the value of inputs not yet validated will reflect the raw, unvalidated and unmodified values.
     If the validation rules for headers, params, query, and payload are defined at both the server routes level and at the route level, the individual route settings override the routes defaults (the rules are not merged).
