     Default value: { engine: require('catbox-memory' }.
     Sets up server-side caching providers. Every server includes a default cache for storing application state. By default, a simple memory-based cache is created which has limited capacity and capabilities.
     hapi uses catbox for its cache implementation which includes support for common storage solutions (e.g. Redis, MongoDB, Memcached, Riak, among others). Caching is only utilized if methods and plugins explicitly store their state in the cache.
     The server cache configuration only defines the storage container itself. The configuration can be assigned one or more (array):
        a class or prototype function (usually obtained by calling require() on a catbox strategy such as require('catbox-redis')). A new catbox client will be created internally using this function.
        a configuration object with the following:
            engine - a class, a prototype function, or a catbox engine object.
            name - an identifier used later when provisioning or configuring caching for server methods or plugins. Each cache name must be unique. A single item may omit the name option which defines the default cache. If every cache includes a name, a default memory cache is provisioned as well.
            shared - if true, allows multiple cache users to share the same segment (e.g. multiple methods using the same cache storage container). Default to false.
            partition - (optional) string used to isolate cached data. Defaults to 'hapi-cache'.
            other options passed to the catbox strategy used. Other options are only passed to catbox when engine above is a class or function and ignored if engine is a catbox engine object).
