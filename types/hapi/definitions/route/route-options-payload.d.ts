 * * 'stream' - the incoming payload is made available via a Stream.Readable interface. If the payload is 'multipart/form-data' and parse is true, field values are presented as text while files are provided as streams. File streams from a 'multipart/form-data' upload will also have a hapi property containing the filename and headers properties. Note that payload streams for multipart payloads are a synthetic interface created on top of the entire mutlipart content loaded into memory. To avoid loading large multipart payloads into memory, set parse to false and handle the multipart payload in the handler using a streaming parser (e.g. pez).

If the payload is 'multipart/form-data' and parse is true, field values are presented as text while files are saved to disk. Note that it is the sole responsibility of the application to clean up the files generated by the framework. This can be done by keeping track of which files are used (e.g. using the request.app object), and listening to the server 'response' event to perform cleanup.
