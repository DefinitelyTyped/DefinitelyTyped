 * If the URL for a transaction matches the provided pattern, name the

 * etc.) are replaced in the name string. BE CAREFUL WHEN USING SUBSTITUTION.
 * If the replacement substrings are highly variable (i.e. are identifiers,
 * GUIDs, or timestamps), the rule will generate too many metrics and
 * potentially get your application blacklisted by New Relic.
 *
 * An example of a good rule with replacements:
 *
 *   newrelic.addNamingRule('^/storefront/(v[1-5])/(item|category|tag)', 'CommerceAPI/$1/$2')
 *
 * An example of a bad rule with replacements:
 *
 *   newrelic.addNamingRule('^/item/([0-9a-f]+)', 'Item/$1')
 *
 * Keep in mind that the original URL and any query parameters will be sent
 * along with the request, so slow transactions will still be identifiable.

 * Naming rules can not be removed once added. They can also be added via the
 * agent's configuration. See configuration documentation for details.
