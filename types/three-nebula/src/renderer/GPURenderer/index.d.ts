 * Performant particle renderer that uses THREE.Points to propagate particle (postiion, rgba etc.,) properties to
 * vertices in a ParticleBufferGeometry.
 * Uses a dynamic texture atlas to support systems with mutliple sprites in a performant way.
 *
 * NOTE! This is an experimental renderer and is currently not covered by tests, coverage will be added when the API
 * is more stable. Currently only compatible with sprite/texture based systems. Meshes are not yet supported.
