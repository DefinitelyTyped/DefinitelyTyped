             * Most values are encoded based on type as described

             * `string`, `list`, or `object`, merge it with the first element in
             * the next list by applying these rules recursively.
             * &#42; `object`: concatenate the (field name, field value) pairs. If a
             * field name is duplicated, then apply these rules recursively
             * to merge the field values.
             *
             * Some examples of merging:
             *
             * # Strings are concatenated.
             * "foo", "bar" => "foobar"

             *
             * # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
             * # because they are strings.
             * ["a", "b"], ["c", "d"] => ["a", "bc", "d"]
             *
             * # Lists are concatenated, but the last and first elements are merged
             * # because they are lists. Recursively, the last and first elements
             * # of the inner lists are merged because they are strings.
             * ["a", ["b", "c"]], [["d"], "e"] => ["a", ["b", "cd"], "e"]
             *
             * # Non-overlapping object fields are combined.
             * {"a": "1"}, {"b": "2"} => {"a": "1", "b": 2"}
             *
             * # Overlapping object fields are merged.
             * {"a": "1"}, {"a": "2"} => {"a": "12"}

             * field. The following `PartialResultSet`s might be yielded:
