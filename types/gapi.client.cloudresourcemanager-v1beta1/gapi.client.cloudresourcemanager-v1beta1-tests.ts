        // without any restrictions. However, to be added as an owner, a user must be
        // invited via Cloud Platform console and must accept the invitation.
        //

        // `setIamPolicy()`; they must be sent only using the Cloud Platform Console.
        // 
        // + Membership changes that leave the project without any owners that have
        // accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) will be rejected.
        // 
        // + If the project is not part of an organization, there must be at least
        // one owner who has accepted the Terms of Service (ToS) agreement in the
        // policy. Calling `setIamPolicy()` to remove the last ToS-accepted owner
