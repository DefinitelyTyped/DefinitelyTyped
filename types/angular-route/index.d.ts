             * `$routeChangeSuccess` event is fired. If any of the promises are rejected the `$routeChangeError` event
             * is fired.
             * For easier access to the resolved dependencies from the template, the `resolve` map will be available on
             * the scope of the route, under `$resolve` (by default) or a custom name specified by the `resolveAs`
             * property (see below). This can be particularly useful, when working with components as route templates.

             * - `factory` - `{string|Function}`: If `string` then it is an alias for a service. Otherwise if function,
             *   then it is called with `$injector#invoke()` and the return value is treated as the dependency. If the
             *   result is a promise, it is resolved before its value is injected into the controller. Be aware that
             *   `ngRoute.$routeParams` will still refer to the previous route within these resolve functions.  Use
             *   `$route.current.params` to access the new route parameters, instead.
