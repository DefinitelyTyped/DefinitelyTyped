         * query language which itself is parsed into an instance of lunr.Query.
         *
         * For programmatically building queries it is advised to directly use lunr.Query, the query language
         * is best used for human entered text rather than program generated text.
         *
         * At its simplest queries can just be a single term, e.g. `hello`, multiple terms are also supported
         * and will be combined with OR, e.g `hello world` will match documents that contain either 'hello'
         * or 'world', though those that contain both will rank higher in the results.
         *
         * Wildcards can be included in terms to match one or more unspecified characters, these wildcards can
         * be inserted anywhere within the term, and more than one wildcard can exist in a single term. Adding
         * wildcards will increase the number of documents that will be found but can also have a negative
         * impact on query performance, especially with wildcards at the beginning of a term.
         *
         * Terms can be restricted to specific fields, e.g. `title:hello`, only documents with the term
         * hello in the title field will match this query. Using a field not present in the index will lead
         * to an error being thrown.
         *
         * Modifiers can also be added to terms, lunr supports edit distance and boost modifiers on terms. A term
         * boost will make documents matching that term score higher, e.g. `foo^5`. Edit distance is also supported
         * to provide fuzzy matching, e.g. 'hello~2' will match documents with hello with an edit distance of 2.
         * Avoid large values for edit distance to improve query performance.
         *
         * To escape special characters the backslash character '\' can be used, this allows searches to include
         * characters that would normally be considered modifiers, e.g. `foo\~2` will search for a term "foo~2" instead
         * of attempting to apply a boost of 2 to the search term "foo".
         *
         * @example <caption>Simple single term query</caption>
         * hello
         * @example <caption>Multiple term query</caption>
         * hello world
         * @example <caption>term scoped to a field</caption>
         * title:hello
         * @example <caption>term with a boost of 10</caption>
