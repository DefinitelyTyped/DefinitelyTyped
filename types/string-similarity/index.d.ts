/**
 * Returns a fraction between 0 and 1, which indicates the degree of similarity between the two strings.
 * `0` indicates completely different strings, `1` indicates identical strings. The comparison is case-insensitive.

 * @param string1 The first string
 * @param string2 The second string
 * @returns A fraction from 0 to 1, both inclusive. Higher number indicates more similarity.
