                 * that have set the scheduling.automaticRestart field to true. In particular, use filtering on nested fields to take advantage of instance labels to
                 * organize and filter results based on label values.
                 *
                 * The Beta API also supports filtering on multiple expressions by providing each separate expression within parentheses. For example,
                 * (scheduling.automaticRestart eq true) (zone eq us-central1-f). Multiple expressions are treated as AND expressions, meaning that resources must match
                 * all expressions to pass the filters.
