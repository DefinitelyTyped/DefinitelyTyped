            <p>
                If you check out the HTML source of this page, you'll notice that it
                already contains the HTML markup of the app that was sent from the
                server!
            </p>

            <p>
                This is great for search engines that need to index this page. It's also
                great for users because server-rendered pages tend to load more quickly
                on mobile devices and over slow networks.
            </p>

            <p>
                Another thing to notice is that when you click one of the links below
                and navigate to a different URL, then hit the refresh button on your
                browser, the server is able to generate the HTML markup for that page as
                well because you're using React Router on the server. This creates a
                seamless experience both for your users navigating around your site and
                for developers on your team who get to use the same routing library in
                both places.
            </p>

            {/* Routes nest inside one another. Nested route paths build upon
