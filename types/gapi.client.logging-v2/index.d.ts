        repository?: string,

        // Optional. Set this to True if this is the last log entry in the operation.
        last?: boolean,
        // Optional. An arbitrary operation identifier. Log entries with the same identifier are assumed to be part of the same operation.
        id?: string,
        // Optional. Set this to True if this is the first log entry in the operation.
        first?: boolean,

    interface LogMetric {
        // Output only. The API version that created or updated this metric. This value is currently always set to V2.
        version?: string,
        // Required. An advanced logs filter which is used to match log entries. Example:
        // "resource.type=gae_app AND severity>=ERROR"
        // The maximum length of the filter is 20000 characters.
        filter?: string,
        // Required. The client-assigned metric identifier. Examples: "error_count", "nginx/requests".Metric identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and the special characters _-.,+!*',()%/. The forward-slash character (/) denotes a hierarchy of name pieces, and it cannot be the first character of the name.The metric identifier in this field must not be URL-encoded (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding). However, when the metric identifier appears as the [METRIC_ID] part of a metric_name API parameter, then the metric identifier must be URL-encoded. Example: "projects/my-project/metrics/nginx%2Frequests".
        name?: string,

        type?: string,
        // Required. Values for all of the labels listed in the associated monitored resource descriptor. For example, Compute Engine VM instances use the labels "project_id", "instance_id", and "zone".

    interface WriteLogEntriesRequest {
        // Required. The log entries to write. Values supplied for the fields log_name, resource, and labels in this entries.write request are inserted into those log entries in this list that do not provide their own values.Stackdriver Logging also creates and inserts values for timestamp and insert_id if the entries do not provide them. The created insert_id for the N'th entry in this list will be greater than earlier entries and less than later entries. Otherwise, the order of log entries in this list does not matter.To improve throughput and to avoid exceeding the quota limit for calls to entries.write, you should write multiple log entries at once rather than calling this method for each individual log entry.
        entries?: LogEntry[],        
        // Optional. A default log resource name that is assigned to all log entries in entries that do not specify a value for log_name:
        // "projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
        // "organizations/[ORGANIZATION_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
        // "billingAccounts/[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
        // "folders/[FOLDER_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]"
        // [LOG_ID] must be URL-encoded. For example, "projects/my-project-id/logs/syslog" or "organizations/1234567890/logs/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com%2Factivity". For more information about log names, see LogEntry.
        logName?: string,
        // Optional. Whether valid entries should be written even if some other entries fail due to INVALID_ARGUMENT or PERMISSION_DENIED errors. If any entry is not written, then the response status is the error associated with one of the failed entries and the response includes error details keyed by the entries' zero-based index in the entries.write method.
        partialSuccess?: boolean,
        // Optional. Default labels that are added to the labels field of all log entries in entries. If a log entry already has a label with the same key as a label in this parameter, then the log entry's label is not changed. See LogEntry.
        labels?: any,
        // Optional. A default monitored resource object that is assigned to all log entries in entries that do not specify a value for resource. Example:
        // { "type": "gce_instance",
        //   "labels": {
        //     "zone": "us-central1-a", "instance_id": "00000000000000000000" }}
        // See LogEntry.

    }
    
    interface LogSink {
        // Required. The client-assigned sink identifier, unique within the project. Example: "my-syslog-errors-to-pubsub". Sink identifiers are limited to 100 characters and can include only the following characters: upper and lower-case alphanumeric characters, underscores, hyphens, and periods.
        name?: string,
        // Optional. This field applies only to sinks owned by organizations and folders. If the field is false, the default, only the logs owned by the sink's parent resource are available for export. If the field is true, then logs from all the projects, folders, and billing accounts contained in the sink's parent resource are also available for export. Whether a particular log entry from the children is exported depends on the sink's filter expression. For example, if this field is true, then the filter resource.type=gce_instance would export all Compute Engine VM instance log entries from all projects in the sink's parent. To only export entries from certain child projects, filter on the project part of the log name:
        // logName:("projects/test-project1/" OR "projects/test-project2/") AND
        // resource.type=gce_instance
        // 
        includeChildren?: boolean,
        // Required. The export destination:
        // "storage.googleapis.com/[GCS_BUCKET]"

        // "pubsub.googleapis.com/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/topics/[TOPIC_ID]"
        // The sink's writer_identity, set when the sink is created, must have permission to write to the destination or else the log entries are not exported. For more information, see Exporting Logs With Sinks.
        destination?: string,
        // Optional. An advanced logs filter. The only exported log entries are those that are in the resource owning the sink and that match the filter. The filter must use the log entry format specified by the output_version_format parameter. For example, in the v2 format:
        // logName="projects/[PROJECT_ID]/logs/[LOG_ID]" AND severity>=ERROR
        // 
        filter?: string,
        // Optional. The time at which this sink will stop exporting log entries. Log entries are exported only if their timestamp is earlier than the end time. If this field is not supplied, there is no end time. If both a start time and an end time are provided, then the end time must be later than the start time.
        endTime?: string,
        // Optional. The time at which this sink will begin exporting log entries. Log entries are exported only if their timestamp is not earlier than the start time. The default value of this field is the time the sink is created or updated.
        startTime?: string,
        // Output only. An IAM identity&mdash;a service account or group&mdash;under which Stackdriver Logging writes the exported log entries to the sink's destination. This field is set by sinks.create and sinks.update, based on the setting of unique_writer_identity in those methods.Until you grant this identity write-access to the destination, log entry exports from this sink will fail. For more information, see Granting access for a resource. Consult the destination service's documentation to determine the appropriate IAM roles to assign to the identity.
        writerIdentity?: string,
        // Deprecated. The log entry format to use for this sink's exported log entries. The v2 format is used by default and cannot be changed.

        // Optional. The resource name of the monitored resource descriptor: "projects/{project_id}/monitoredResourceDescriptors/{type}" where {type} is the value of the type field in this object and {project_id} is a project ID that provides API-specific context for accessing the type. APIs that do not use project information can use the resource name format "monitoredResourceDescriptors/{type}".

        description?: string,

Retry the method with this value for page_token to continue the search. Alternatively, consider speeding up the search by changing your filter to specify a single log name or resource type, or to narrow the time range of the search.

[LOG_ID] must be less than 512 characters long and can only include the following characters: upper and lower case alphanumeric characters, forward-slash, underscore, hyphen, and period.For backward compatibility, if log_name begins with a forward-slash, such as /projects/..., then the log entry is ingested as usual but the forward-slash is removed. Listing the log entry will not show the leading slash and filtering for a log name with a leading slash will never return any results.

        projectIds?: string[],        
        // Optional. A filter that chooses which log entries to return. See Advanced Logs Filters. Only log entries that match the filter are returned.
