# Phaser 3 Definitions Contribution Notes

This is a heavily modified version of the official type definitions found in Phaser's [documentation repo](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-docs).
The modifications are done to comply with DefinitelyTyped's guidelines and linting rules.

Consider these definitions an alternative to the official typings until the official one is bundled with the phaser npm package.

Please do not submit issues to the official Phaser repositories regarding issues with these type definitions.

The official type definitions found in Phaser's [documentation repo](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-docs) are generated by parsing JsDocs.
Before submitting pull requests for improvements and fixing issues in this version, please consider also submitting improvements to the JsDocs used to generate the official type definitions in [Phaser's repo](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser), or see if you can help improve the parser that generated the official typings that these are based on at Phaser's [documentation repo](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-docs).
