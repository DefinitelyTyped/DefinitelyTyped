# Phaser 3 Definitions Contribution Notes

These type definitions are automatically generated by parsing JsDocs of the Phaser 3 library.

Before submitting pull requests for improvements and fixing issues, please consider submitting improvements to the JsDocs used to generate the type defintions in [Phaser's repo](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) instead.

The parser used to generate the typings lives in Phaser's [documentation repo](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-docs).
