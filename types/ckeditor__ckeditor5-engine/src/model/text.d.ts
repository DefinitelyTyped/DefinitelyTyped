/**
 * Model text node. Type of {@link module:engine/model/node~Node node} that contains {@link module:engine/model/text~Text#data text data}.
 *
 * **Important:** see {@link module:engine/model/node~Node} to read about restrictions using `Text` and `Node` API.
 *
 * **Note:** keep in mind that `Text` instances might indirectly got removed from model tree when model is changed.
 * This happens when {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer model writer} is used to change model and the text node is merged with
 * another text node. Then, both text nodes are removed and a new text node is inserted into the model. Because of
 * this behavior, keeping references to `Text` is not recommended. Instead, consider creating
 * {@link module:engine/model/liveposition~LivePosition live position} placed before the text node.
