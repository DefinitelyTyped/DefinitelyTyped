     * immediately if it is not nested in any other change block, but if it is nested in another (enqueue)change block,
     * it will be delayed and executed after the outermost block.

     *
     * In addition to that, the changes enqueued with `enqueueChange()` will be converted separately from the changes
     * done in the outer `change()` block.
     *
     * Second, it lets you define the {@link module:engine/model/batch~Batch} into which you want to add your changes.
     * By default, a new batch is created. In the sample above, `change` and `enqueueChange` blocks use a different

     * # Conversion and schema
     *
     * Inserting elements and text nodes into the model is not enough to make CKEditor 5 render that content
     * to the user. CKEditor 5 implements a model-view-controller architecture and what `model.insertContent()` does
     * is only adding nodes to the model. Additionally, you need to define
     * {@glink framework/guides/architecture/editing-engine#conversion converters} between the model and view
     * and define those nodes in the {@glink framework/guides/architecture/editing-engine#schema schema}.
     *
     * So, while this method may seem similar to CKEditor 4 `editor.insertHtml()` (in fact, both methods
     * are used for paste-like content insertion), the CKEditor 5 method cannot be use to insert arbitrary HTML
     * unless converters are defined for all elements and attributes in that HTML.
     *
     * # Examples
     *
     * Using `insertContent()` with a manually created model structure:
     *
     *        // Let's create a document fragment containing such content as:
     *        //
     *        // <paragraph>foo</paragraph>
     *        // <blockQuote>
     *        //    <paragraph>bar</paragraph>
     *        // </blockQuote>
     *        const docFrag = editor.model.change( writer => {
     *            const p1 = writer.createElement( 'paragraph' );
     *            const p2 = writer.createElement( 'paragraph' );
     *            const blockQuote = writer.createElement( 'blockQuote' );
     *            const docFrag = writer.createDocumentFragment();
     *
     *            writer.append( p1, docFrag );
     *            writer.append( blockQuote, docFrag );
     *            writer.append( p2, blockQuote );
     *            writer.insertText( 'foo', p1 );
     *            writer.insertText( 'bar', p2 );
     *
     *            return docFrag;
     *        } );
     *
     *        // insertContent() does not have to be used in a change() block. It can, though,
     *        // so this code could be moved to the callback defined above.
     *        editor.model.insertContent( docFrag );
     *
     * Using `insertContent()` with an HTML string converted to a model document fragment (similar to the pasting mechanism):
     *
     *        // You can create your own HtmlDataProcessor instance or use editor.data.processor
     *        // if you have not overridden the default one (which is the HtmlDataProcessor instance).
     *        const htmlDP = new HtmlDataProcessor( viewDocument );
     *
     *        // Convert an HTML string to a view document fragment:
     *        const viewFragment = htmlDP.toView( htmlString );
     *
     *        // Convert the view document fragment to a model document fragment
     *        // in the context of $root. This conversion takes the schema into
     *        // account so if, for example, the view document fragment contained a bare text node,
     *        // this text node cannot be a child of $root, so it will be automatically
     *        // wrapped with a <paragraph>. You can define the context yourself (in the second parameter),
     *        // and e.g. convert the content like it would happen in a <paragraph>.
     *        // Note: The clipboard feature uses a custom context called $clipboardHolder
     *        // which has a loosened schema.
     *        const modelFragment = editor.data.toModel( viewFragment );
     *
     *        editor.model.insertContent( modelFragment );
     *
     * By default this method will use the document selection but it can also be used with a position, range or selection instance.
     *
     *        // Insert text at the current document selection position.
     *        editor.model.change( writer => {
     *            editor.model.insertContent( writer.createText( 'x' ) );
     *        } );
     *
     *        // Insert text at a given position - the document selection will not be modified.
     *        editor.model.change( writer => {
     *            editor.model.insertContent( writer.createText( 'x' ), doc.getRoot(), 2 );
     *
     *            // Which is a shorthand for:
     *            editor.model.insertContent( writer.createText( 'x' ), writer.createPositionAt( doc.getRoot(), 2 ) );
     *        } );
     *
     * If you want the document selection to be moved to the inserted content, use the
     * {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer#setSelection `setSelection()`} method of the writer after inserting
     * the content:
     *
     *        editor.model.change( writer => {
     *            const paragraph = writer.createElement( 'paragraph' );
     *
     *            // Insert an empty paragraph at the beginning of the root.
     *            editor.model.insertContent( paragraph, writer.createPositionAt( editor.model.document.getRoot(), 0 ) );
     *
     *            // Move the document selection to the inserted paragraph.
     *            writer.setSelection( paragraph, 'in' );
     *        } );
     *
     * If an instance of the {@link module:engine/model/selection~Selection model selection} is passed as `selectable`,
     * the new content will be inserted at the passed selection (instead of document selection):
     *
     *        editor.model.change( writer => {
     *            // Create a selection in a paragraph that will be used as a place of insertion.
     *            const selection = writer.createSelection( paragraph, 'in' );
     *
     *            // Insert the new text at the created selection.
     *            editor.model.insertContent( writer.createText( 'x' ), selection );
     *
     *            // insertContent() modifies the passed selection instance so it can be used to set the document selection.
     *            // Note: This is not necessary when you passed the document selection to insertContent().
     *            writer.setSelection( selection );
     *        } );

     *  * `'character'` (default) - moves selection by one user-perceived character. In most cases this means moving by one
     *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines "combing marks". These are special symbols, that combines
     *  with a symbol before it ("base character") to create one user-perceived character. For example, `qÌ‡Ì£` is a normal
     *  letter `q` with two "combining marks": upper dot (`Ux0307`) and lower dot (`Ux0323`). For most actions, i.e. extending

     *  selection between "base character" and "combining mark", because "combining marks" have their own unicode code points.
     *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by
     *  two characters, called "surrogate pairs". Halves of "surrogate pairs" have a meaning only when placed next to each other.
     *  For example `ð¨­Ž` is represented in `String` by `\uD862\uDF4E`. Both `\uD862` and `\uDF4E` do not have any meaning
     *  outside the pair (are rendered as ? when alone). Position between them would be incorrect. In this case, selection
     *  extension will include whole "surrogate pair".
