/**
 * UI element class. It should be used to represent editing UI which needs to be injected into the editing view
 * If possible, you should keep your UI outside the editing view. However, if that is not possible,
 * UI elements can be used.
 *
 * How a UI element is rendered is in your control (you pass a callback to
 * {@link module:engine/view/downcastwriter~DowncastWriter#createUIElement `downcastWriter#createUIElement()`}).
 * The editor will ignore your UI element â€“ the selection cannot be placed in it, it is skipped (invisible) when
 * the user modifies the selection by using arrow keys and the editor does not listen to any mutations which
 * happen inside your UI elements.
 *
 * The limitation is that you cannot convert a model element to a UI element. UI elements need to be
 * created for {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~Marker markers} or as additinal elements
 * inside normal {@link module:engine/view/containerelement~ContainerElement container elements}.
 *
 * To create a new UI element use the
 * {@link module:engine/view/downcastwriter~DowncastWriter#createUIElement `downcastWriter#createUIElement()`} method.
