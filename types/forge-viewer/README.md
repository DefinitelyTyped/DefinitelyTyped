# Summary
This package contains type definitions for Autodesk Forge Viewer.js Library (https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v7/reference/Viewing/).

# Details
These are for our Model Visualization library Viewer.js which at the moment can only be loaded externally from our CDN via script tags so the library itself is not a NPM package at the moment.
