         *        0.0: the standard, uniform Catmull-Rom spline
         *        0.5: the centripetal Catmull-Rom spline, guaranteeing no self-intersections
         *        1.0: the chordal Catmull-Rom spline
         *   'geometric' use a simple heuristic and empiric geometric method to smooth the segment’s handles. The handles were weighted, meaning that big differences in distances between the segments will lead to probably undesired results.
