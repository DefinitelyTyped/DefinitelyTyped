/**
 * A D3 Drag Behavior
 *
 * The first generic refers to the type of element to be dragged.
 * The second generic refers to the type of the datum of the dragged element.
 * The third generic refers to the type of the drag behavior subject.
 *
 * The subject of a drag gesture represents the thing being dragged.
 * It is computed when an initiating input event is received,
 * such as a mousedown or touchstart, immediately before the drag gesture starts.
 * The subject is then exposed as event.subject on subsequent drag events for this gesture.
 *
 * The default subject is the datum of the element in the originating selection (see drag)
 * that received the initiating input event; if this datum is undefined,
 * an object representing the coordinates of the pointer is created.
 * When dragging circle elements in SVG, the default subject is thus the datum of the circle being dragged.
 * With Canvas, the default subject is the canvas element’s datum (regardless of where on the canvas you click).
 * In this case, a custom subject accessor would be more appropriate,
 * such as one that picks the closest circle to the mouse within a given search radius.
