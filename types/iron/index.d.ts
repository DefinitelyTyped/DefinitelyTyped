/**
 * iron is a cryptographic utility for sealing a JSON object using symmetric key encryption with message integrity
 * verification. Or in other words, it lets you encrypt an object, send it around (in cookies, authentication
 * credentials, etc.), then receive it back and decrypt it. The algorithm ensures that the message was not tampered
 * with, and also provides a simple mechanism for password rotation.
 * [See docs](https://github.com/hueniverse/iron)

    /**
     * iron provides a few options for customizing the key deriviation algorithm used to generate encryption and
     * integrity verification keys as well as the algorithms and salt sizes used. The 'seal()' and 'unseal()'
     * methods take an options object with the following required keys:
     * * encryption - defines the options used by the encryption process.
     * * integrity - defines the options used by the HMAC integrity verification process.
     * Each of these option objects includes the following required keys:
     * * saltBits - the size of the salt (random buffer used to ensure that two identical objects will generate a different encrypted result.
     * * algorithm - the algorithm used ('aes-256-cbc' for encryption and 'sha256' for integrity are the only two supported at this time).
     * * iterations - the number of iterations used to derive a key from the password. Set to 1 by default. The number of ideal iterations to use is dependent on your application's performance requirements. More iterations means it takes longer to generate the key.
     * The 'seal()' and 'unseal()' methods also take the following optional options keys:
     * * ttl - sealed object lifetime in milliseconds where 0 means forever. Defaults to 0.
     * * timestampSkewSec - number of seconds of permitted clock skew for incoming expirations. Defaults to 60 seconds.
     * * localtimeOffsetMsec - local clock time offset, expressed in number of milliseconds (positive or negative). Defaults to 0.
     * [See docs](https://github.com/hueniverse/iron#options)
