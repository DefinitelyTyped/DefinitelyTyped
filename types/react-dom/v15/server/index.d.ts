 * Render a React element to its initial HTML. This should only be used on the server.

 * engines to crawl your pages for SEO purposes.
 *
 * If you call `ReactDOM.render()` on a node that already has this server-rendered markup,
 * React will preserve it and only attach event handlers, allowing you
 * to have a very performant first-load experience.
