/**
 * Keystroke handler allows registering callbacks for given keystrokes.
 *
 * The most frequent use of this class is through the {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor#keystrokes `editor.keystrokes`}
 * property. It allows listening to keystrokes executed in the editing view:
 *
 *  editor.keystrokes.set( 'Ctrl+A', ( keyEvtData, cancel ) => {
 *   console.log( 'Ctrl+A has been pressed' );
 *   cancel();
 *  } );
 *
 * However, this utility class can be used in various part of the UI. For instance, a certain {@link module:ui/view~View}
 * can use it like this:
 *
 *  class MyView extends View {
 *   constructor() {
 *    this.keystrokes = new KeystrokeHandler();
 *
 *    	this.keystrokes.set( 'tab', handleTabKey );
 *   }
 *
 *   render() {
 *    super.render();
 *
 *    this.keystrokes.listenTo( this.element );
 *   }
 *  }
 *
 * That keystroke handler will listen to `keydown` events fired in this view's main element.
 *
