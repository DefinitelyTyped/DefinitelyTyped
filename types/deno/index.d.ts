     *
     * A key-value database that can be used to store and retrieve data.
     *
     * Data is stored as key-value pairs, where the key is a {@linkcode Deno.KvKey}
     * and the value is an arbitrary structured-serializable JavaScript value.
     * Keys are ordered lexicographically as described in the documentation for
     * {@linkcode Deno.KvKey}. Keys are unique within a database, and the last
     * value set for a given key is the one that is returned when reading the
     * key. Keys can be deleted from the database, in which case they will no
     * longer be returned when reading keys.
     *
     * Values can be any structured-serializable JavaScript value (objects,
     * arrays, strings, numbers, etc.). The special value {@linkcode Deno.KvU64}
     * can be used to store 64-bit unsigned integers in the database. This special
     * value can not be nested within other objects or arrays. In addition to the
     * regular database mutation operations, the unsigned 64-bit integer value
     * also supports `sum`, `max`, and `min` mutations.
     *
     * Keys are versioned on write by assigning the key an ever-increasing
     * "versionstamp". The versionstamp represents the version of a key-value pair
     * in the database at some point in time, and can be used to perform
     * transactional operations on the database without requiring any locking.
     * This is enabled by atomic operations, which can have conditions that ensure
     * that the operation only succeeds if the versionstamp of the key-value pair
     * matches an expected versionstamp.
     *
     * Keys have a maximum length of 2048 bytes after serialization. Values have a
     * maximum length of 64 KiB after serialization. Serialization of both keys
     * and values is somewhat opaque, but one can usually assume that the
     * serialization of any value is about the same length as the resulting string
     * of a JSON serialization of that same value. If theses limits are exceeded,
     * an exception will be thrown.

     * **UNSTABLE**: New API, yet to be vetted.
     *
     * APIs for working with the OpenTelemetry observability framework. Deno can
     * export traces, metrics, and logs to OpenTelemetry compatible backends via
     * the OTLP protocol.
     *
     * Deno automatically instruments the runtime with OpenTelemetry traces and
     * metrics. This data is exported via OTLP to OpenTelemetry compatible
     * backends. User logs from the `console` API are exported as OpenTelemetry
     * logs via OTLP.
     *
     * User code can also create custom traces, metrics, and logs using the
     * OpenTelemetry API. This is done using the official OpenTelemetry package
     * for JavaScript:
     * [`npm:@opentelemetry/api`](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/js/).
     * Deno integrates with this package to provide tracing, metrics, and trace
     * context propagation between native Deno APIs (like `Deno.serve` or `fetch`)
     * and custom user code. Deno automatically registers the providers with the
     * OpenTelemetry API, so users can start creating custom traces, metrics, and
     * logs without any additional setup.
     *
     * @example Using OpenTelemetry API to create custom traces
     * ```ts,ignore
     * import { trace } from "npm:@opentelemetry/api@1";
     *
     * const tracer = trace.getTracer("example-tracer");
     *
     * async function doWork() {
     *   return tracer.startActiveSpan("doWork", async (span) => {
     *     span.setAttribute("key", "value");
     *     await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
     *     span.end();
     *   });
     * }
     *
     * Deno.serve(async (req) => {
     *   await doWork();
     *   const resp = await fetch("https://example.com");
     *   return resp;
     * });
     * ```
