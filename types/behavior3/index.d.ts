/**
 * Behavior3JS
 * ===========
 *
 * * * *
 *
 * **Behavior3JS** is a Behavior Tree library written in JavaScript. It
 * provides structures and algorithms that assist you in the task of creating
 * intelligent agents for your game or application. Check it out some features
 * of Behavior3JS:
 *
 * - Based on the work of (Marzinotto et al., 2014), in which they propose a
 *   **formal**, **consistent** and **general** definition of Behavior Trees;
 * - **Optimized to control multiple agents**: you can use a single behavior
 *   tree instance to handle hundreds of agents;
 * - It was **designed to load and save trees in a JSON format**, in order to
 *   use, edit and test it in multiple environments, tools and languages;
 * - A **cool visual editor** which you can access online;
 * - Several **composite, decorator and action nodes** available within the
 *   library. You still can define your own nodes, including composites and
 *   decorators;
 * - **Completely free**, the core module and the visual editor are all
 *   published under the MIT License, which means that you can use them for
 *   your open source and commercial projects;
 * - **Lightweight**!
 *
 * Visit http://behavior3.com to know more!
 *
 *
 * ## Core Classes and Functions
 *
 * This library include the following core structures...
 *
 *
 * **Public:**
 *
 * - **BehaviorTree**: the structure that represents a Behavior Tree;
 * - **Blackboard**: represents a "memory" in an agent and is required to to
 *   run a `BehaviorTree`;
 * - **Composite**: base class for all composite nodes;
 * - **Decorator**: base class for all decorator nodes;
 * - **Action**: base class for all action nodes;
 * - **Condition**: base class for all condition nodes;
 *
 *
 * **Internal:**
 *
 * - **Tick**: used as container and tracking object through the tree during
 *   the tick signal;
 * - **BaseNode**: the base class that provide all common node features;
 *
 * *Some classes are used internally on Behavior3JS, but you may need to access
 * its functionalities eventually, specially the `Tick` object.*
 *
 *
 * **Nodes:**
 *
 * - **Composite Nodes**: Sequence, Priority, MemSequence, MemPriority.
 * - **Decorators**: Inverter, Limiter, MaxTime, Repeater,
 *   RepeaterUntilFailure, RepeaterUntilSuccess.
 * - **Actions**: Succeeder, Failer, Error, Runner, Wait.

     * The BehaviorTree class, as the name implies, represents the Behavior Tree
     * structure.
     *
     * There are two ways to construct a Behavior Tree: by manually setting the
     * root node, or by loading it from a data structure (which can be loaded
     * from a JSON). Both methods are shown in the examples below and better
     * explained in the user guide.
     *
     * The tick method must be called periodically, in order to send the tick
     * signal to all nodes in the tree, starting from the root. The method
     * `BehaviorTree.tick` receives a target object and a blackboard as
     * parameters. The target object can be anything: a game agent, a system, a
     * DOM object, etc. This target is not used by any piece of Behavior3JS,
     * i.e., the target object will only be used by custom nodes.
     *
     * The blackboard is obligatory and must be an instance of `Blackboard`. This
     * requirement is necessary due to the fact that neither `BehaviorTree` or
     * any node will store the execution variables in its own object (e.g., the
     * BT does not store the target, information about opened nodes or number of
     * times the tree was called). But because of this, you only need a single
     * tree instance to control multiple (maybe hundreds) objects.

     * Manual construction of a Behavior Tree
     * --------------------------------------
     *
     *     var tree = new b3.BehaviorTree();

     *     tree.root = new b3.Sequence({children:[
     *       new b3.Priority({children:[
