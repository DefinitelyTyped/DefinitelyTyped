 * Model `paragraph` inside a table cell can be rendered as `<span>` or `<p>`. It is rendered as `<span>` if this is the only block
 * element in that table cell and it does not have any attributes. It is rendered as `<p>` otherwise.
 *
 * When table cell content changes, for example a second `paragraph` element is added, we need to ensure that the first `paragraph` is
 * re-rendered so it changes from `<span>` to `<p>`. The easiest way to do it is to re-render the entire table cell.
