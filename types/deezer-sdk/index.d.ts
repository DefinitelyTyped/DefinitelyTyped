// Type definitions for non-npm package deezer-sdk 0.0
// Project: https://developers.deezer.com/sdk/javascript
// Definitions by: Marco Eckstein <https://github.com/marco-eckstein>
// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped
// TypeScript Version: 2.1

// = Notes =
//
// == Versioning ==
//
// The Deezer JavaScript SDK is not versioned (confirmed by support).
// Definitions reflect SDK as of mid-April 2019.
// So, semantic versioning mandates version 0.0.*.
//
// == Doc ==
//
// Not using @see tags because they are not supported by TSDoc (https://microsoft.github.io/tsdoc/).
//
// == Usage ==
//
// There may be other ways, but this works for an Angular project:
//
// 1. Add Deezer library to a script tag, as described in https://developers.deezer.com/sdk/javascript.
//
// 2. Add
//
// "devDependencies": {
// 	...
//  "@types/deezer-sdk": "...",
//  ...
// }
//
// to package.json.
//
// 3. Add
//
// /// <reference types="@types/youtube"/>
//
// to the beginning of app.module.ts.
