/**
 * Creates an instance of the `Environment` interface defined in
 * RelayStoreTypes with a mocked network layer.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 * ```
 * const environment = RelayModernMockEnvironment.createMockEnvironment();
 * ```
 *
 * Mock API:
 *
 * Helpers are available as `environment.mock.<helper>`:
 *
 * - `isLoading(query, variables): boolean`: Determine whether the given query
 *   is currently being loaded (not yet rejected/resolved).
 * - `reject(query, error: Error): void`: Reject a query that has been fetched
 *   by the environment.
 * - `resolve(query, payload: PayloadData): void`: Resolve a query that has been
 *   fetched by the environment.
 * - `nextValue(...) - will add payload to the processing, but won't complete
 *   the request ()
 * - getAllOperations() - every time there is an operation created by
 *   the Relay Component (query, mutation, subscription) this operation will be
 *   added to the internal list on the Mock Environment. This method will return
 *   an array of all pending operations in the order they occurred.
 * - findOperation(findFn) - should find operation if findFn(...) return `true`
 *   for it. Otherwise, it will throw.
 * - getMostRecentOperation(...) - should return the most recent operation
 *   generated by Relay Component.
 * - resolveMostRecentOperation(...) - is accepting `GraphQLResponse` or a
 *   callback function that will receive `operation` and should return
 *  `GraphQLResponse`
 * - rejectMostRecentOperation(...) - should reject the most recent operation
 *   with a specific error
