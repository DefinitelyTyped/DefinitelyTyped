/**
 * Creates a readable stream that samples and emits memory usage over time.
 *
 * The stream emits samples in the form of JavaScript objects:
 *
 * ```
 * {
 *   rss: 4935680,       // Resident set size: Memory assigned to the process in bytes
 *   heapTotal: 1826816, // V8 heap memory allocated in bytes
 *   heapUsed: 650472,   // V8 heap memory used in bytes
 *   ts: 1479179912921,  // UNIX epoch timestamp for sample in milliseconds (only present if `options.ts` is `true`)
 *   gc: null            // Indicates if sample was taken after a garbage collection run (only present if `options.gc` is `true`)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * import * as fs from 'fs'
 * import csvWriter = require('csv-write-stream')
 * import memoryUsage = require('memory-usage')
 *
 * memoryUsage(2000)
 *   .pipe(csvWriter())
 *   .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('memory.csv'))
