/**
 * The Transition component lets you describe a transition from one component
 * state to another _over time_ with a simple declarative API. Most commonly
 * It's used to animate the mounting and unmounting of Component, but can also
 * be used to describe in-place transition states as well.
 *
 * By default the `Transition` component does not alter the behavior of the
 * component it renders, it only tracks "enter" and "exit" states for the components.
 * It's up to you to give meaning and effect to those states. For example we can
 * add styles to a component when it enters or exits:
 *
 * ```jsx
 * import Transition from 'react-transition-group/Transition';
 *
 * const duration = 300;
 *
 * const defaultStyle = {
 *   transition: `opacity ${duration}ms ease-in-out`,
 *   opacity: 0,
 * }
 *
 * const transitionStyles = {
 *   entering: { opacity: 1 },
 *   entered:  { opacity: 1 },
 * };
 *
 * const Fade = ({ in: inProp }) => (
 *   <Transition in={inProp} timeout={duration}>
 *     {(state) => (
 *       <div style={{
 *         ...defaultStyle,
 *         ...transitionStyles[state]
 *       }}>
 *         I'm A fade Transition!
 *       </div>
 *     )}
