     * Send and receive messages using web browsers.
     * <p>
     * This programming interface lets a JavaScript client application use the MQTT V3.1 or
     * V3.1.1 protocol to connect to an MQTT-supporting messaging server.
     *
     * The function supported includes:
     * <ol>
     * <li>Connecting to and disconnecting from a server. The server is identified by its host name and port number.
     * <li>Specifying options that relate to the communications link with the server,
     * for example the frequency of keep-alive heartbeats, and whether SSL/TLS is required.
     * <li>Subscribing to and receiving messages from MQTT Topics.
     * <li>Publishing messages to MQTT Topics.
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * The API consists of two main objects:
     * <dl>
     * <dt><b>{@link Paho.MQTT.Client}</b></dt>
     * <dd>This contains methods that provide the functionality of the API,
     * including provision of callbacks that notify the application when a message
     * arrives from or is delivered to the messaging server,
     * or when the status of its connection to the messaging server changes.</dd>
     * <dt><b>{@link Paho.MQTT.Message}</b></dt>
     * <dd>This encapsulates the payload of the message along with various attributes
     * associated with its delivery, in particular the destination to which it has
     * been (or is about to be) sent.</dd>
     * </dl>
     * <p>
     * The programming interface validates parameters passed to it, and will throw
     * an Error containing an error message intended for developer use, if it detects
     * an error with any parameter.
     * <p>
