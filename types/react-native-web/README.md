# `react-native-web`

> React Native for Web is an accessible implementation of React Native's Components and APIs that is interoperable with React DOM. https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/
Because it is not an identical implementation of `react-native`, it adds or modifies existing type signatures on exported components and APIs from `react-native`.

These types are an attempt to augment existing `react-native` types to match the behavior when `react-native-web` is implemented in a project.
