	/**
	 * Namespace for participating in language-specific editor [features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved),
	 * like IntelliSense, code actions, diagnostics etc.
	 *
	 * Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features
	 * like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
	 * programming languages.
	 *
	 * The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
	 * by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
	 * that can be called with a [TextDocument](#TextDocument) and a [Position](#Position) returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
	 * mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
	 *
	 * ```javascript
	 * languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
	 * 	provideHover(document, position, token) {
	 * 		return new Hover('I am a hover!');
	 * 	}
	 * });
	 * ```
	 *
	 * Registration is done using a [document selector](#DocumentSelector) which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
	 * a more complex [filter](#DocumentFilter) like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
	 * a selector will result in a [score](#languages.match) that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
	 * scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like [hover](#languages.registerHoverProvider),
	 * the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like [IntelliSense](#languages.registerCompletionItemProvider) the
	 * score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

		 * Compute the match between a document [selector](#DocumentSelector) and a document. Values
		 * greater than zero mean the selector matches the document.
		 *
		 * A match is computed according to these rules:
		 * 1. When [`DocumentSelector`](#DocumentSelector) is an array, compute the match for each contained `DocumentFilter` or language identifier and take the maximum value.
		 * 2. A string will be desugared to become the `language`-part of a [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter), so `"fooLang"` is like `{ language: "fooLang" }`.
		 * 3. A [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter) will be matched against the document by comparing its parts with the document. The following rules apply:
		 *  1. When the `DocumentFilter` is empty (`{}`) the result is `0`
		 *  2. When `scheme`, `language`, or `pattern` are defined but one doesn’t match, the result is `0`
		 *  3. Matching against `*` gives a score of `5`, matching via equality or via a glob-pattern gives a score of `10`
		 *  4. The result is the maximun value of each match
		 *
		 * Samples:
		 * ```js
		 * // default document from disk (file-scheme)
		 * doc.uri; //'file:///my/file.js'
		 * doc.languageId; // 'javascript'
		 * match('javascript', doc); // 10;
		 * match({language: 'javascript'}, doc); // 10;
		 * match({language: 'javascript', scheme: 'file'}, doc); // 10;
		 * match('*', doc); // 5
		 * match('fooLang', doc); // 0
		 * match(['fooLang', '*'], doc); // 5
		 *
		 * // virtual document, e.g. from git-index
		 * doc.uri; // 'git:/my/file.js'
		 * doc.languageId; // 'javascript'
		 * match('javascript', doc); // 10;
