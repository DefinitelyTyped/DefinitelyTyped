        onDidChangeSemanticTokens?: Event<void>;

        /**
         * Tokens in a file are represented as an array of integers. The position of each token is expressed relative to
         * the token before it, because most tokens remain stable relative to each other when edits are made in a file.
         *
         * ---
         * In short, each token takes 5 integers to represent, so a specific token `i` in the file consists of the following array indices:
         *  - at index `5*i`   - `deltaLine`: token line number, relative to the previous token
         *  - at index `5*i+1` - `deltaStart`: token start character, relative to the previous token (relative to 0 or the previous token's start if they are on the same line)
         *  - at index `5*i+2` - `length`: the length of the token. A token cannot be multiline.
         *  - at index `5*i+3` - `tokenType`: will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenTypes`. We currently ask that `tokenType` < 65536.
         *  - at index `5*i+4` - `tokenModifiers`: each set bit will be looked up in `SemanticTokensLegend.tokenModifiers`
         *
         * ---
         * ### How to encode tokens
         *
         * Here is an example for encoding a file with 3 tokens in a uint32 array:
         * ```
         *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: "property",  tokenModifiers: ["private", "static"] },
         *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: "type",      tokenModifiers: [] },
         *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: "class",     tokenModifiers: [] }
         * ```
         *
         * 1. First of all, a legend must be devised. This legend must be provided up-front and capture all possible token types.
         * For this example, we will choose the following legend which must be passed in when registering the provider:
         * ```
         *    tokenTypes: ['property', 'type', 'class'],
         *    tokenModifiers: ['private', 'static']
         * ```
         *
         * 2. The first transformation step is to encode `tokenType` and `tokenModifiers` as integers using the legend. Token types are looked
         * up by index, so a `tokenType` value of `1` means `tokenTypes[1]`. Multiple token modifiers can be set by using bit flags,
         * so a `tokenModifier` value of `3` is first viewed as binary `0b00000011`, which means `[tokenModifiers[0], tokenModifiers[1]]` because
         * bits 0 and 1 are set. Using this legend, the tokens now are:
         * ```
         *    { line: 2, startChar:  5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
         *    { line: 2, startChar: 10, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
         *    { line: 5, startChar:  2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
         * ```
         *
         * 3. The next step is to represent each token relative to the previous token in the file. In this case, the second token
         * is on the same line as the first token, so the `startChar` of the second token is made relative to the `startChar`
         * of the first token, so it will be `10 - 5`. The third token is on a different line than the second token, so the
         * `startChar` of the third token will not be altered:
         * ```
         *    { deltaLine: 2, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 3, tokenType: 0, tokenModifiers: 3 },
         *    { deltaLine: 0, deltaStartChar: 5, length: 4, tokenType: 1, tokenModifiers: 0 },
         *    { deltaLine: 3, deltaStartChar: 2, length: 7, tokenType: 2, tokenModifiers: 0 }
         * ```
         *
         * 4. Finally, the last step is to inline each of the 5 fields for a token in a single array, which is a memory friendly representation:
         * ```
         *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
         *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
         * ```
         *
         * @see [SemanticTokensBuilder](#SemanticTokensBuilder) for a helper to encode tokens as integers.
         * *NOTE*: When doing edits, it is possible that multiple edits occur until VS Code decides to invoke the semantic tokens provider.
         * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot temporarily compute semantic tokens, it can indicate this by throwing an error with the message 'Busy'.
         */

        /**
         * Instead of always returning all the tokens in a file, it is possible for a `DocumentSemanticTokensProvider` to implement
         * this method (`provideDocumentSemanticTokensEdits`) and then return incremental updates to the previously provided semantic tokens.
         *
         * ---
         * ### How tokens change when the document changes
         *
         * Suppose that `provideDocumentSemanticTokens` has previously returned the following semantic tokens:
         * ```
         *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
         *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
         * ```
         *
         * Also suppose that after some edits, the new semantic tokens in a file are:
         * ```
         *    // 1st token,  2nd token,  3rd token
         *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ]
         * ```
         * It is possible to express these new tokens in terms of an edit applied to the previous tokens:
         * ```
         *    [  2,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // old tokens
         *    [  3,5,3,0,3,  0,5,4,1,0,  3,2,7,2,0 ] // new tokens
         *
         *    edit: { start:  0, deleteCount: 1, data: [3] } // replace integer at offset 0 with 3
         * ```
         *
         * *NOTE*: If the provider cannot compute `SemanticTokensEdits`, it can "give up" and return all the tokens in the document again.
         * *NOTE*: All edits in `SemanticTokensEdits` contain indices in the old integers array, so they all refer to the previous result state.

     * // Update state
     * setState({ value: oldState.value + 1 })
     * ```
     *
     * A `WebviewPanelSerializer` extends this persistence across restarts of VS Code. When the editor is shutdown,
     * VS Code will save off the state from `setState` of all webviews that have a serializer. When the
     * webview first becomes visible after the restart, this state is passed to `deserializeWebviewPanel`.

         * ```typescript
         * vscode.window.registerUriHandler({
         *   handleUri(uri: vscode.Uri): vscode.ProviderResult<void> {

         * `asExternalUri`.

     * Namespace for participating in language-specific editor [features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved),
     * like IntelliSense, code actions, diagnostics etc.
     *
     * Many programming languages exist and there is huge variety in syntaxes, semantics, and paradigms. Despite that, features
     * like automatic word-completion, code navigation, or code checking have become popular across different tools for different
     * programming languages.
     *
     * The editor provides an API that makes it simple to provide such common features by having all UI and actions already in place and
     * by allowing you to participate by providing data only. For instance, to contribute a hover all you have to do is provide a function
     * that can be called with a [TextDocument](#TextDocument) and a [Position](#Position) returning hover info. The rest, like tracking the
     * mouse, positioning the hover, keeping the hover stable etc. is taken care of by the editor.
     *
     * ```javascript
     * languages.registerHoverProvider('javascript', {
     *     provideHover(document, position, token) {
     *         return new Hover('I am a hover!');
     *     }
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * Registration is done using a [document selector](#DocumentSelector) which is either a language id, like `javascript` or
     * a more complex [filter](#DocumentFilter) like `{ language: 'typescript', scheme: 'file' }`. Matching a document against such
     * a selector will result in a [score](#languages.match) that is used to determine if and how a provider shall be used. When
     * scores are equal the provider that came last wins. For features that allow full arity, like [hover](#languages.registerHoverProvider),
     * the score is only checked to be `>0`, for other features, like [IntelliSense](#languages.registerCompletionItemProvider) the
     * score is used for determining the order in which providers are asked to participate.

         * 1. When [`DocumentSelector`](#DocumentSelector) is an array, compute the match for each contained `DocumentFilter` or language identifier and take the maximum value.
         * 2. A string will be desugared to become the `language`-part of a [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter), so `"fooLang"` is like `{ language: "fooLang" }`.
         * 3. A [`DocumentFilter`](#DocumentFilter) will be matched against the document by comparing its parts with the document. The following rules apply:
         *  1. When the `DocumentFilter` is empty (`{}`) the result is `0`
         *  2. When `scheme`, `language`, or `pattern` are defined but one doesn’t match, the result is `0`
