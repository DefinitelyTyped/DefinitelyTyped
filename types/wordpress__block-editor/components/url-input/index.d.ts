         * This prop allows the suggestions list to be programmatically not rendered by passing a
         * booleanâ€”it can be `true` to make sure suggestions aren't rendered, or `false`/`undefined`
         * to fall back to the default behaviour of showing suggestions when matching autocompletion
         * items are found.
