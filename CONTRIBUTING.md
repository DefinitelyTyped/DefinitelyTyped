Thank you for contributing! By contributing code, documentation, or other changes you agree to license your contributions under the project's MIT license (see `LICENSE`) and follow the project guidelines below.

## Quick checklist

- Follow the instructions in `README.md` for package-specific rules.
- Add tests and documentation where appropriate.
- Run the CI checks locally when possible.
- Include a DCO sign-off on your commits (see below).

## Sign-off (DCO)

This repository requires that commits be "Signed-off-by" the contributor to indicate acceptance of the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). Add the sign-off with one of these methods:

- Use `git commit -s` to automatically add a sign-off line, or

If you are using a single commit locally, you can also amend it with:

  git commit --amend -s
