DefinitelyTyped
===============

The repository for *high quality* TypeScript type definitions.

Use a definition file like this:

```
/// <reference path="jquery.d.ts" />
```

Contributor Guidelines
----------------------
Definition files should be called 'library.d.ts'.
In case there are multiple versions supported, the latest one will be without a version number in the file name.
Older versions will be in the form of 'library-1.0.d.ts'.

Test files called 'library-tests.ts'.
They are not runnable, in the TDD way.
They contain code that should compile with no errors, usually taken from the documentation.samples of the library.
It is very desirable each new contribution to contain tests too.

Other means to get the definitions
