// Type definitions for bluebird 2.0.0
// Project: https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird
// Definitions by: Bart van der Schoor <https://github.com/Bartvds>, falsandtru <https://github.com/falsandtru>
// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped

// ES6 model with generics overload was sourced and trans-multiplied from es6-promises.d.ts
// By: Campredon <https://github.com/fdecampredon/>

// Warning: recommended to use `tsc > v0.9.7` (critical bugs in earlier generic code):
// - https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/1563

// Note: replicate changes to all overloads in both definition and test file
// Note: keep both static and instance members inline (so similar)

// TODO fix remaining TODO annotations in both definition and test

// TODO verify support to have no return statement in handlers to get a Promise<void> (more overloads?)
