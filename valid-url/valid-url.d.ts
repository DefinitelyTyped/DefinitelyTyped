    /**
    * Is the value a well-formed HTTP uri?
    * Specialized version of isUri() that only likes http:// urls.  As a result, it can also do a much more thorough job validating.  Also, unlike isUri() it is more concerned with only allowing real-world URIs through.  Things like relative hostnames are allowed by the standards, but probably aren't wise.  Conversely, null paths aren't allowed per RFC 2616 (should be '/' instead), but are allowed by this function.
    *
    * This function only works for fully-qualified URIs.  /bob.html won't work. See RFC 3986 for the appropriate method to turn a relative URI into an absolute one given its context.
    *
    * Note that you probably want to either call this in combo with is_https_uri().
    * i.e. if(isHttpUri(uri) || isHttpsUri(uri)) console.log('Good');
    * or use the convenience method isWebUri which is equivalent.
    * @param {string} value - The potential URI to test.
    * @returns {string} - The untainted RFC 3986 URI on success, undefined on failure.

    /**
    * Is the value a well-formed HTTPS uri?
    *See is_http_uri() for details.  This version only likes the https URI scheme. Otherwise it's identical to is_http_uri().
    * @param {string} value - The potential URI to test.
    * @returns {string} - The untainted RFC 3986 URI on success, undefined on failure.

    /**
    * Is the value a well-formed HTTP or HTTPS uri?
    * This is just a convenience method that combines isHttpUri and isHttpsUri to accept most common real-world URLs.
    * @param {string} value - The potential URI to test.
    * @returns {string} - The untainted RFC 3986 URI on success, undefined on failure.
