        * autolow emphasizes speed at first but improves appearance whenever possible. Playback begins with anti-aliasing turned off. If Flash Player detects that the processor can handle it, anti-aliasing is turned on.
        * autohigh emphasizes playback speed and appearance equally at first but sacrifices appearance for playback speed if necessary. Playback begins with anti-aliasing turned on. If the actual frame rate drops below the specified frame rate, anti-aliasing is turned off to improve playback speed. Use this setting to emulate the View > Antialias setting in Flash Professional.
        * medium applies some anti-aliasing and does not smooth bitmaps. It produces a better quality than the Low setting, but lower quality than the High setting.
        * high favors appearance over playback speed and always applies anti-aliasing. If the movie does not contain animation, bitmaps are smoothed; if the movie has animation, bitmaps are not smoothed.
        * best provides the best display quality and does not consider playback speed. All output is anti-aliased and all bitmaps are smoothed.

        * Possible values: window, direct, opaque, transparent, gpu. Sets the Window Mode property of the SWF file for transparency, layering, positioning, and rendering in the browser. If this attribute is omitted, the default value is "window". For more information, see Using Window Mode (wmode) values below.
        * window - The SWF content plays in its own rectangle ("window") on a web page. The browser determines how the SWF content is layered against other HTML elements. With this value, you cannot explicitly specify if SWF content appears above or below other HTML elements on the page.
        * direct - Use direct to path rendering. This attribute bypasses compositing in the screen buffer and renders the SWF content directly to the screen. This wmode value is recommended to provide the best performance for content playback. It enables hardware accelerated presentation of SWF content that uses Stage Video or Stage 3D.
        * opaque - The SWF content is layered together with other HTML elements on the page. The SWF file is opaque and hides everything layered behind it on the page. This option reduces playback performance compared to wmode=window or wmode=direct.
        * transparent - The SWF content is layered together with other HTML elements on the page. The SWF file background color (Stage color) is transparent. HTML elements beneath the SWF file are visible through any transparent areas of the SWF, with alpha blending. This option reduces playback performance compared to wmode=window or wmode=direct.
        * gpu - Use additional hardware acceleration on some Internet-connected TVs and mobile devices. In contrast to other wmode values, pixel fidelity for display list graphics is not guaranteed. Otherwise, this value is similar to wmode=direct.
