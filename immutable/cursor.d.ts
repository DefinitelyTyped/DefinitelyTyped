/**
 * Cursors
 * -------
 *
 * Cursors allow you to hold a reference to a path in a nested immutable data
 * structure, allowing you to pass smaller sections of a larger nested
 * collection to portions of your application while maintaining a central point
 * aware of changes to the entire data structure.
 *
 * This is particularly useful when used in conjuction with component-based UI
 * libraries like [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) or to simulate
 * "state" throughout an application while maintaining a single flow of logic.
 *
 * Cursors provide a simple API for getting the value at that path
 * (the equivalent of `this.getIn(keyPath)`), updating the value at that path
 * (the equivalent of `this.updateIn(keyPath)`), and getting a sub-cursor
 * starting from that path.
 *
 * When updated, a new root collection is created and provided to the `onChange`
 * function provided to the first call to `Cursor(map, onChange)`.
 *
 * When this cursor's (or any of its sub-cursors') `update` method is called,
 * the resulting new data structure will be provided to the `onChange`
 * function. Use this callback to keep track of the most current value or
 * update the rest of your application.
