         * higher precedence than other notes, you should never set a value
         * greater than the current time (as defined for a Timetstamp). To
         * place a note at higher precedence than existing notes, set the
         * value to the current time as defined for a timestamp (milliseconds

         * the note is a reminder.    Clients may implement a separate
         * "sort by date" feature to show notes ordered by reminderTime.
         * Whenever a reminderDoneTime or reminderTime is set but a
