 * File-like objects/artifacts 
 * (which are neither a meta archetype model, nor an instance model) 
 * are stored separately from the WebGME meta-models and models. 
 * An example of such an artifact would be a resource 
 * file that is associated with a model 
 * (e.g., data for an instance model, or a generated artifact from analyzing a model).
 * 
 * One reason for treating these objects differently is that they do not conform to the data model, 
 * and they might not be well-suited for storage in a database 
 * (the Blob is suited to handle binary objects of any size and structure).
