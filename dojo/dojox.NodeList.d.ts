         * Array-like object which adds syntactic
         * sugar for chaining, common iteration operations, animation, and
         * node manipulation. NodeLists are most often returned as the
         * result of dojo/query() calls.
         * NodeList instances provide many utilities that reflect
         * core Dojo APIs for Array iteration and manipulation, DOM
         * manipulation, and event handling. Instead of needing to dig up
         * functions in the dojo package, NodeLists generally make the
         * full power of Dojo available for DOM manipulation tasks in a
         * simple, chainable way.
