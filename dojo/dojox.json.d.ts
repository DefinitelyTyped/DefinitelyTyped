         * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojox/json/query.html
         *
         * Performs a JSONQuery on the provided object and returns the results.
         * If no object is provided (just a query), it returns a "compiled" function that evaluates objects
         * according to the provided query.
         * JSONQuery provides a comprehensive set of data querying tools including filtering,
         * recursive search, sorting, mapping, range selection, and powerful expressions with
         * wildcard string comparisons and various operators. JSONQuery generally supersets
         * JSONPath and provides syntax that matches and behaves like JavaScript where
         * possible.
         *
         * JSONQuery evaluations begin with the provided object, which can referenced with
         * $. From
         * the starting object, various operators can be successively applied, each operating
         * on the result of the last operation.
         *
         * Supported Operators
         * .property - This will return the provided property of the object, behaving exactly
         * like JavaScript.
         * [expression] - This returns the property name/index defined by the evaluation of
         * the provided expression, behaving exactly like JavaScript.
         * [?expression] - This will perform a filter operation on an array, returning all the
         * items in an array that match the provided expression. This operator does not
         * need to be in brackets, you can simply use ?expression, but since it does not
         * have any containment, no operators can be used afterwards when used
         * without brackets.
         * [^?expression] - This will perform a distinct filter operation on an array. This behaves
         * as [?expression] except that it will remove any duplicate values/objects from the
         * result set.
         * [/expression], [\expression], [/expression, /expression] - This performs a sort
         * operation on an array, with sort based on the provide expression. Multiple comma delimited sort
         * expressions can be provided for multiple sort orders (first being highest priority). /
         * indicates ascending order and \ indicates descending order
         * [=expression] - This performs a map operation on an array, creating a new array
         * with each item being the evaluation of the expression for each item in the source array.
         * [start:end:step] - This performs an array slice/range operation, returning the elements
         * from the optional start index to the optional end index, stepping by the optional step number.
         * [expr,expr] - This a union operator, returning an array of all the property/index values from
         * the evaluation of the comma delimited expressions.
         * . or [] - This returns the values of all the properties of the current object.
         * $ - This is the root object, If a JSONQuery expression does not being with a $,
         * it will be auto-inserted at the beginning.
         * @ - This is the current object in filter, sort, and map expressions. This is generally
         * not necessary, names are auto-converted to property references of the current object
         * in expressions.
         * ..property - Performs a recursive search for the given property name, returning
         * an array of all values with such a property name in the current object and any subobjects
         * expr = expr - Performs a comparison (like JS's ==). When comparing to
         * a string, the comparison string may contain wildcards * (matches any number of
         * characters) and ? (matches any single character).
         * expr ~ expr - Performs a string comparison with case insensitivity.
         * ..[?expression] - This will perform a deep search filter operation on all the objects and
         * subobjects of the current data. Rather than only searching an array, this will search
         * property values, arrays, and their children.
         * $1,$2,$3, etc. - These are references to extra parameters passed to the query
         * function or the evaluator function.
         * +, -, /, *, &, |, %, (, ), <, >, <=, >=, != - These operators behave just as they do
         * in JavaScript.
         * dojox.json.query(queryString,object)
         * and
         *
         * dojox.json.query(queryString)(object)
         * always return identical results. The first one immediately evaluates, the second one returns a
         *
         * function that then evaluates the object.
