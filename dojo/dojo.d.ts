         * Permalink: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.9/dojo/_base/Deferred.html
         *
         * Deprecated.   This module defines the legacy dojo/_base/Deferred API.
         * New code should use dojo/Deferred instead.
         * The Deferred API is based on the concept of promises that provide a
         * generic interface into the eventual completion of an asynchronous action.
         * The motivation for promises fundamentally is about creating a
         * separation of concerns that allows one to achieve the same type of
         * call patterns and logical data flow in asynchronous code as can be
         * achieved in synchronous code. Promises allows one
         * to be able to call a function purely with arguments needed for
         * execution, without conflating the call with concerns of whether it is
         * sync or async. One shouldn't need to alter a call's arguments if the
         * implementation switches from sync to async (or vice versa). By having
         * async functions return promises, the concerns of making the call are
         * separated from the concerns of asynchronous interaction (which are
         * handled by the promise).
         * 
         * The Deferred is a type of promise that provides methods for fulfilling the
         * promise with a successful result or an error. The most important method for
         * working with Dojo's promises is the then() method, which follows the
         * CommonJS proposed promise API. An example of using a Dojo promise:
         * 
         * var resultingPromise = someAsyncOperation.then(function(result){
         *     ... handle result ...
         * },
         * function(error){
         *     ... handle error ...
         * });
         * The .then() call returns a new promise that represents the result of the
         * execution of the callback. The callbacks will never affect the original promises value.
         * 
         * The Deferred instances also provide the following functions for backwards compatibility:
         * 
         * addCallback(handler)
         * addErrback(handler)
         * callback(result)
         * errback(result)
         * Callbacks are allowed to return promises themselves, so
         * you can build complicated sequences of events with ease.
         * 
         * The creator of the Deferred may specify a canceller.  The canceller
         * is a function that will be called if Deferred.cancel is called
         * before the Deferred fires. You can use this to implement clean
         * aborting of an XMLHttpRequest, etc. Note that cancel will fire the
         * deferred with a CancelledError (unless your canceller returns
         * another kind of error), so the errbacks should be prepared to
         * handle that error for cancellable Deferreds.

             * Deprecated.   This module defines the legacy dojo/_base/Deferred API.
             * New code should use dojo/Deferred instead.
             * The Deferred API is based on the concept of promises that provide a
             * generic interface into the eventual completion of an asynchronous action.
             * The motivation for promises fundamentally is about creating a
             * separation of concerns that allows one to achieve the same type of
             * call patterns and logical data flow in asynchronous code as can be
             * achieved in synchronous code. Promises allows one
             * to be able to call a function purely with arguments needed for
             * execution, without conflating the call with concerns of whether it is
             * sync or async. One shouldn't need to alter a call's arguments if the
             * implementation switches from sync to async (or vice versa). By having
             * async functions return promises, the concerns of making the call are
             * separated from the concerns of asynchronous interaction (which are
             * handled by the promise).
             * 
             * The Deferred is a type of promise that provides methods for fulfilling the
             * promise with a successful result or an error. The most important method for
             * working with Dojo's promises is the then() method, which follows the
             * CommonJS proposed promise API. An example of using a Dojo promise:
             * 
             * var resultingPromise = someAsyncOperation.then(function(result){
             *     ... handle result ...
             * },
             * function(error){
             *     ... handle error ...
             * });

             * The creator of the Deferred may specify a canceller.  The canceller

             * deferred with a CancelledError (unless your canceller returns
             * another kind of error), so the errbacks should be prepared to

            /**
             * loads a Javascript module from the appropriate URI
             * Modules are loaded via dojo.require by using one of two loaders: the normal loader
             * and the xdomain loader. The xdomain loader is used when dojo was built with a
             * custom build that specified loader=xdomain and the module lives on a modulePath
             * that is a whole URL, with protocol and a domain. The versions of Dojo that are on
             * the Google and AOL CDNs use the xdomain loader.
             * 
             * If the module is loaded via the xdomain loader, it is an asynchronous load, since
             * the module is added via a dynamically created script tag. This
             * means that dojo.require() can return before the module has loaded. However, this
             * should only happen in the case where you do dojo.require calls in the top-level
             * HTML page, or if you purposely avoid the loader checking for dojo.require
             * dependencies in your module by using a syntax like dojo["require"] to load the module.
             * 
             * Sometimes it is useful to not have the loader detect the dojo.require calls in the
             * module so that you can dynamically load the modules as a result of an action on the
             * page, instead of right at module load time.
             * 
             * Also, for script blocks in an HTML page, the loader does not pre-process them, so
             * it does not know to download the modules before the dojo.require calls occur.
             * 
             * So, in those two cases, when you want on-the-fly module loading or for script blocks
             * in the HTML page, special care must be taken if the dojo.required code is loaded
             * asynchronously. To make sure you can execute code that depends on the dojo.required
             * modules, be sure to add the code that depends on the modules in a dojo.addOnLoad()
             * callback. dojo.addOnLoad waits for all outstanding modules to finish loading before
             * executing.
             * 
             * This type of syntax works with both xdomain and normal loaders, so it is good
             * practice to always use this idiom for on-the-fly code loading and in HTML script
             * blocks. If at some point you change loaders and where the code is loaded from,
             * it will all still work.
             * 
             * More on how dojo.require
             * dojo.require("A.B") first checks to see if symbol A.B is
             * defined. If it is, it is simply returned (nothing to do).
             * 
             * If it is not defined, it will look for A/B.js in the script root
             * directory.
             * 
             * dojo.require throws an exception if it cannot find a file
             * to load, or if the symbol A.B is not defined after loading.
             * 
             * It returns the object A.B, but note the caveats above about on-the-fly loading and
             * HTML script blocks when the xdomain loader is loading a module.
             * 
             * dojo.require() does nothing about importing symbols into
             * the current namespace.  It is presumed that the caller will
             * take care of that.
             * 
             * @param moduleName module name to load, using periods for separators, e.g. "dojo.date.locale".  Module paths are de-referenced by dojo'sinternal mapping of locations to names and are disambiguated bylongest prefix.

             * @param omitModuleCheck               Optionalif true, omitModuleCheck skips the step of ensuring that theloaded file actually defines the symbol it is referenced by.For example if it called as dojo.require("a.b.c") and thefile located at a/b/c.js does not define an object a.b.c,and exception will be throws whereas no exception is raisedwhen called as dojo.require("a.b.c", true)

                 * To load a bundle means to insert the bundle into the plugin's cache and publish the bundle
                 * value to the loader. Given , , and a particular , the cache key
                 * 
                 * <path>/nls/<bundle>/<locale>
                 * will hold the value. Similarly, then plugin will publish this value to the loader by
                 * 
                 * define("<path>/nls/<bundle>/<locale>", <bundle-value>);
                 * Given this algorithm, other machinery can provide fast load paths be preplacing
                 * values in the plugin's cache, which is public. When a load is demanded the
                 * cache is inspected before starting any loading. Explicitly placing values in the plugin
                 * cache is an advanced/experimental feature that should not be needed; use at your own risk.
                 * 
                 * For the normal AMD algorithm, the root bundle is loaded first, which instructs the
                 * plugin what additional localized bundles are required for a particular locale. These
                 * additional locales are loaded and a mix of the root and each progressively-specific
                 * locale is returned. For example:
                 * 
                 * The client demands "dojo/i18n!some/path/nls/someBundle
                 * The loader demands load(some/path/nls/someBundle)
                 * This plugin require's "some/path/nls/someBundle", which is the root bundle.
                 * Assuming config.locale is "ab-cd-ef" and the root bundle indicates that localizations
                 * are available for "ab" and "ab-cd-ef" (note the missing "ab-cd", then the plugin
                 * requires "some/path/nls/ab/someBundle" and "some/path/nls/ab-cd-ef/someBundle"
                 * Upon receiving all required bundles, the plugin constructs the value of the bundle
                 * ab-cd-ef as...
                 *  mixin(mixin(mixin({}, require("some/path/nls/someBundle"),
                 *      require("some/path/nls/ab/someBundle")),
                 *      require("some/path/nls/ab-cd-ef/someBundle"));
                 * 
                 * This value is inserted into the cache and published to the loader at the
                 * key/module-id some/path/nls/someBundle/ab-cd-ef.
                 * 
                 * The special preload signature (case 3) instructs the plugin to stop servicing all normal requests
                 * (further preload requests will be serviced) until all ongoing preloading has completed.
                 * 
                 * The preload signature instructs the plugin that a special rollup module is available that contains
                 * one or more flattened, localized bundles. The JSON array of available locales indicates which locales
                 * are available. Here is an example:
                 * 
                 * *preload*some/path/nls/someModule*["root", "ab", "ab-cd-ef"]
                 * This indicates the following rollup modules are available:
                 * 
                 * some/path/nls/someModule_ROOT
                 * some/path/nls/someModule_ab
                 * some/path/nls/someModule_ab-cd-ef
                 * Each of these modules is a normal AMD module that contains one or more flattened bundles in a hash.
                 * For example, assume someModule contained the bundles some/bundle/path/someBundle and
                 * some/bundle/path/someOtherBundle, then some/path/nls/someModule_ab would be expressed as follows:
                 * 
                 * define({
                 *     some/bundle/path/someBundle:<value of someBundle, flattened with respect to locale ab>,
                 *     some/bundle/path/someOtherBundle:<value of someOtherBundle, flattened with respect to locale ab>,
                 * });
                 * E.g., given this design, preloading for locale=="ab" can execute the following algorithm:
                 * 
                 * require(["some/path/nls/someModule_ab"], function(rollup){
                 *     for(var p in rollup){
                 *         var id = p + "/ab",
                 *         cache[id] = rollup[p];
                 *         define(id, rollup[p]);
                 *     }
                 * });
                 * Similarly, if "ab-cd" is requested, the algorithm can determine that "ab" is the best available and
                 * load accordingly.
                 * 
                 * The builder will write such rollups for every layer if a non-empty localeList  profile property is
                 * provided. Further, the builder will include the following cache entry in the cache associated with
                 * any layer.
                 * 
                 * "*now":function(r){r(['dojo/i18n!*preload*<path>/nls/<module>*<JSON array of available locales>']);}
                 * The *now special cache module instructs the loader to apply the provided function to context-require
                 * with respect to the particular layer being defined. This causes the plugin to hold all normal service
                 * requests until all preloading is complete.
                 * 
                 * Notice that this algorithm is rarely better than the standard AMD load algorithm. Consider the normal case
                 * where the target locale has a single segment and a layer depends on a single bundle:
                 * 
                 * Without Preloads:
                 * 
                 * Layer loads root bundle.
                 * bundle is demanded; plugin loads single localized bundle.
                 * With Preloads:
                 * 
                 * Layer causes preloading of target bundle.
                 * bundle is demanded; service is delayed until preloading complete; bundle is returned.
                 * In each case a single transaction is required to load the target bundle. In cases where multiple bundles
                 * are required and/or the locale has multiple segments, preloads still requires a single transaction whereas
                 * the normal path requires an additional transaction for each additional bundle/locale-segment. However all
                 * of these additional transactions can be done concurrently. Owing to this analysis, the entire preloading
                 * algorithm can be discard during a build by setting the has feature dojo-preload-i18n-Api to false.

             * implements a fetch method that automatically handles eight of the fetch()
             * arguments -- onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onError, start, count, sort and scope
             * The class mixing in simpleFetch should not implement fetch(),
             * but should instead implement a _fetchItems() method.  The _fetchItems()
             * method takes three arguments, the keywordArgs object that was passed
             * to fetch(), a callback function to be called when the result array is
             * available, and an error callback to be called if something goes wrong.
             * The _fetchItems() method should ignore any keywordArgs parameters for
             * start, count, onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onError, sort, and scope.
             * The _fetchItems() method needs to correctly handle any other keywordArgs
             * parameters, including the query parameter and any optional parameters
             * (such as includeChildren).  The _fetchItems() method should create an array of
             * result items and pass it to the fetchHandler along with the original request object --
             * or, the _fetchItems() method may, if it wants to, create an new request object
             * with other specifics about the request that are specific to the datastore and pass
             * that as the request object to the handler.
             * 
             * For more information on this specific function, see dojo/data/api/Read.fetch()
             * 
             * @param request               OptionalThe keywordArgs parameter may either be an instance ofconforming to dojo/data/api/Request or may be a simple anonymous objectthat may contain any of the following:{    query: query-object or query-string,    queryOptions: object,    onBegin: Function,    onItem: Function,    onComplete: Function,    onError: Function,    scope: object,    start: int    count: int    sort: array}All implementations should accept keywordArgs objects with any ofthe 9 standard properties: query, onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onErrorscope, sort, start, and count.  Some implementations may accept additionalproperties in the keywordArgs object as valid parameters, such as{includeOutliers:true}.The query parameterThe query may be optional in some data store implementations.The dojo/data/api/Read API does not specify the syntax or semanticsof the query itself -- each different data store implementationmay have its own notion of what a query should look like.However, as of dojo 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1, all the provided datastores in dojo.dataand dojox.data support an object structure query, where the object is a set ofname/value parameters such as { attrFoo: valueBar, attrFoo1: valueBar1}.  Most of thedijit widgets, such as ComboBox assume this to be the case when working with a datastorewhen they dynamically update the query.  Therefore, for maximum compatibility with dijitwidgets the recommended query parameter is a key/value object.  That does not mean that thethe datastore may not take alternative query forms, such as a simple string, a Date, a number,or a mix of such.  Ultimately, The dojo/data/api/Read API is agnostic about what the queryformat.Further note:  In general for query objects that accept strings as attributevalue matches, the store should also support basic filtering capability, such as (match any character) and ? (match single character).  An example query that is a query objectwould be like: { attrFoo: "value"}.  Which generally means match all items where they havean attribute named attrFoo, with a value that starts with 'value'.The queryOptions parameterThe queryOptions parameter is an optional parameter used to specify options that may modifythe query in some fashion, such as doing a case insensitive search, or doing a deep searchwhere all items in a hierarchical representation of data are scanned instead of just the rootitems.  It currently defines two options that all datastores should attempt to honor if possible:{    ignoreCase: boolean, // Whether or not the query should match case sensitively or not.  Default behaviour is false.    deep: boolean   // Whether or not a fetch should do a deep search of items and all child                    // items instead of just root-level items in a datastore.  Default is false.}The onBegin parameter.function(size, request);If an onBegin callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, before the first onItem callback is called.The onBegin callback function will be passed two arguments, thethe total number of items identified and the Request object.  If the total number isunknown, then size will be -1.  Note that size is not necessarily the size of thecollection of items returned from the query, as the request may have specified to return only asubset of the total set of items through the use of the start and count parameters.The onItem parameter.function(item, request);If an onItem callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called as each item in the result is received. The callbackfunction will be passed two arguments: the item itself, and theRequest object.The onComplete parameter.function(items, request);If an onComplete callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, after the last onItem callback is called.Note that if the onItem callback is not present, then onComplete will be passedan array containing all items which matched the query and the request object.If the onItem callback is present, then onComplete is called as:onComplete(null, request).The onError parameter.function(errorData, request);If an onError callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called if there is any sort of error while attempting toexecute the query.The onError callback function will be passed two arguments:an Error object and the Request object.The scope parameter.If a scope object is provided, all of the callback functions (onItem,onComplete, onError, etc) will be invoked in the context of the scopeobject.  In the body of the callback function, the value of the "this"keyword will be the scope object.   If no scope object is provided,the callback functions will be called in the context of dojo.global().For example, onItem.call(scope, item, request) vs.onItem.call(dojo.global(), item, request)The start parameter.If a start parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly start returning items once the start number of items have been located andskipped.  When this parameter is paired with 'count', the store should be ableto page across queries with millions of hits by only returning subsets of thehits for each queryThe count parameter.If a count parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly return up to that many items.  This allows a fetch call that may havemillions of item matches to be paired down to something reasonable.The sort parameter.If a sort parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore tosort the items in some manner before returning the items.  The array is an array ofjavascript objects that must conform to the following format to be applied to thefetching of items:{    attribute: attribute || attribute-name-string,    descending: true|false;   // Optional.  Default is false.}Note that when comparing attributes, if an item contains no value for the attribute(undefined), then it the default ascending sort logic should push it to the bottomof the list.  In the descending order case, it such items should appear at the top of the list.

             * The class mixing in simpleFetch should not implement fetch(),

             * start, count, onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onError, sort, and scope.
             * The _fetchItems() method needs to correctly handle any other keywordArgs
             * parameters, including the query parameter and any optional parameters
             * (such as includeChildren).  The _fetchItems() method should create an array of
             * result items and pass it to the fetchHandler along with the original request object --

             * that as the request object to the handler.
             * 
             * For more information on this specific function, see dojo/data/api/Read.fetch()

             * @param request               OptionalThe keywordArgs parameter may either be an instance ofconforming to dojo/data/api/Request or may be a simple anonymous objectthat may contain any of the following:{    query: query-object or query-string,    queryOptions: object,    onBegin: Function,    onItem: Function,    onComplete: Function,    onError: Function,    scope: object,    start: int    count: int    sort: array}All implementations should accept keywordArgs objects with any ofthe 9 standard properties: query, onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onErrorscope, sort, start, and count.  Some implementations may accept additionalproperties in the keywordArgs object as valid parameters, such as{includeOutliers:true}.The query parameterThe query may be optional in some data store implementations.The dojo/data/api/Read API does not specify the syntax or semanticsof the query itself -- each different data store implementationmay have its own notion of what a query should look like.However, as of dojo 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1, all the provided datastores in dojo.dataand dojox.data support an object structure query, where the object is a set ofname/value parameters such as { attrFoo: valueBar, attrFoo1: valueBar1}.  Most of thedijit widgets, such as ComboBox assume this to be the case when working with a datastorewhen they dynamically update the query.  Therefore, for maximum compatibility with dijitwidgets the recommended query parameter is a key/value object.  That does not mean that thethe datastore may not take alternative query forms, such as a simple string, a Date, a number,or a mix of such.  Ultimately, The dojo/data/api/Read API is agnostic about what the queryformat.Further note:  In general for query objects that accept strings as attributevalue matches, the store should also support basic filtering capability, such as (match any character) and ? (match single character).  An example query that is a query objectwould be like: { attrFoo: "value"}.  Which generally means match all items where they havean attribute named attrFoo, with a value that starts with 'value'.The queryOptions parameterThe queryOptions parameter is an optional parameter used to specify options that may modifythe query in some fashion, such as doing a case insensitive search, or doing a deep searchwhere all items in a hierarchical representation of data are scanned instead of just the rootitems.  It currently defines two options that all datastores should attempt to honor if possible:{    ignoreCase: boolean, // Whether or not the query should match case sensitively or not.  Default behaviour is false.    deep: boolean   // Whether or not a fetch should do a deep search of items and all child                    // items instead of just root-level items in a datastore.  Default is false.}The onBegin parameter.function(size, request);If an onBegin callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, before the first onItem callback is called.The onBegin callback function will be passed two arguments, thethe total number of items identified and the Request object.  If the total number isunknown, then size will be -1.  Note that size is not necessarily the size of thecollection of items returned from the query, as the request may have specified to return only asubset of the total set of items through the use of the start and count parameters.The onItem parameter.function(item, request);If an onItem callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called as each item in the result is received. The callbackfunction will be passed two arguments: the item itself, and theRequest object.The onComplete parameter.function(items, request);If an onComplete callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, after the last onItem callback is called.Note that if the onItem callback is not present, then onComplete will be passedan array containing all items which matched the query and the request object.If the onItem callback is present, then onComplete is called as:onComplete(null, request).The onError parameter.function(errorData, request);If an onError callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called if there is any sort of error while attempting toexecute the query.The onError callback function will be passed two arguments:an Error object and the Request object.The scope parameter.If a scope object is provided, all of the callback functions (onItem,onComplete, onError, etc) will be invoked in the context of the scopeobject.  In the body of the callback function, the value of the "this"keyword will be the scope object.   If no scope object is provided,the callback functions will be called in the context of dojo.global().For example, onItem.call(scope, item, request) vs.onItem.call(dojo.global(), item, request)The start parameter.If a start parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly start returning items once the start number of items have been located andskipped.  When this parameter is paired with 'count', the store should be ableto page across queries with millions of hits by only returning subsets of thehits for each queryThe count parameter.If a count parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly return up to that many items.  This allows a fetch call that may havemillions of item matches to be paired down to something reasonable.The sort parameter.If a sort parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore tosort the items in some manner before returning the items.  The array is an array ofjavascript objects that must conform to the following format to be applied to thefetching of items:{    attribute: attribute || attribute-name-string,    descending: true|false;   // Optional.  Default is false.}Note that when comparing attributes, if an item contains no value for the attribute(undefined), then it the default ascending sort logic should push it to the bottomof the list.  In the descending order case, it such items should appear at the top of the list.

Some implementations may accept additionalproperties in the keywordArgs object as valid parameters, such as{includeOutliers:true}.The query parameterThe query may be optional in some data store implementations.The dojo/data/api/Read API does not specify the syntax or semanticsof the query itself -- each different data store implementationmay have its own notion of what a query should look like.However, as of dojo 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1, all the provided datastores in dojo.dataand dojox.data support an object structure query, where the object is a set ofname/value parameters such as { attrFoo: valueBar, attrFoo1: valueBar1}.  Most of thedijit widgets, such as ComboBox assume this to be the case when working with a datastorewhen they dynamically update the query.  Therefore, for maximum compatibility with dijitwidgets the recommended query parameter is a key/value object.  That does not mean that thethe datastore may not take alternative query forms, such as a simple string, a Date, a number,or a mix of such.  Ultimately, The dojo/data/api/Read API is agnostic about what the queryformat.Further note:  In general for query objects that accept strings as attributevalue matches, the store should also support basic filtering capability, such as (match any character) and ? (match single character).  An example query that is a query objectwould be like: { attrFoo: "value"}.  Which generally means match all items where they havean attribute named attrFoo, with a value that starts with 'value'.The queryOptions parameterThe queryOptions parameter is an optional parameter used to specify options that may modifythe query in some fashion, such as doing a case insensitive search, or doing a deep searchwhere all items in a hierarchical representation of data are scanned instead of just the rootitems.  It currently defines two options that all datastores should attempt to honor if possible:{    ignoreCase: boolean, // Whether or not the query should match case sensitively or not.  Default behaviour is false.    deep: boolean   // Whether or not a fetch should do a deep search of items and all child                    // items instead of just root-level items in a datastore.  Default is false.}The onBegin parameter.function(size, request);If an onBegin callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, before the first onItem callback is called.The onBegin callback function will be passed two arguments, thethe total number of items identified and the Request object.  If the total number isunknown, then size will be -1.  Note that size is not necessarily the size of thecollection of items returned from the query, as the request may have specified to return only asubset of the total set of items through the use of the start and count parameters.The onItem parameter.function(item, request);If an onItem callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called as each item in the result is received. The callbackfunction will be passed two arguments: the item itself, and theRequest object.The onComplete parameter.function(items, request);If an onComplete callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, after the last onItem callback is called.Note that if the onItem callback is not present, then onComplete will be passedan array containing all items which matched the query and the request object.If the onItem callback is present, then onComplete is called as:onComplete(null, request).The onError parameter.function(errorData, request);If an onError callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called if there is any sort of error while attempting toexecute the query.The onError callback function will be passed two arguments:an Error object and the Request object.The scope parameter.If a scope object is provided, all of the callback functions (onItem,onComplete, onError, etc) will be invoked in the context of the scopeobject.  In the body of the callback function, the value of the "this"keyword will be the scope object.   If no scope object is provided,the callback functions will be called in the context of dojo.global().For example, onItem.call(scope, item, request) vs.onItem.call(dojo.global(), item, request)The start parameter.If a start parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly start returning items once the start number of items have been located andskipped.  When this parameter is paired with 'count', the store should be ableto page across queries with millions of hits by only returning subsets of thehits for each queryThe count parameter.If a count parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly return up to that many items.  This allows a fetch call that may havemillions of item matches to be paired down to something reasonable.The sort parameter.If a sort parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore tosort the items in some manner before returning the items.  The array is an array ofjavascript objects that must conform to the following format to be applied to thefetching of items:{    attribute: attribute || attribute-name-string,    descending: true|false;   // Optional.  Default is false.}Note that when comparing attributes, if an item contains no value for the attribute(undefined), then it the default ascending sort logic should push it to the bottomof the list.  In the descending order case, it such items should appear at the top of the list.

Some implementations may accept additionalproperties in the keywordArgs object as valid parameters, such as{includeOutliers:true}.The query parameterThe query may be optional in some data store implementations.The dojo/data/api/Read API does not specify the syntax or semanticsof the query itself -- each different data store implementationmay have its own notion of what a query should look like.However, as of dojo 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1, all the provided datastores in dojo.dataand dojox.data support an object structure query, where the object is a set ofname/value parameters such as { attrFoo: valueBar, attrFoo1: valueBar1}.  Most of thedijit widgets, such as ComboBox assume this to be the case when working with a datastorewhen they dynamically update the query.  Therefore, for maximum compatibility with dijitwidgets the recommended query parameter is a key/value object.  That does not mean that thethe datastore may not take alternative query forms, such as a simple string, a Date, a number,or a mix of such.  Ultimately, The dojo/data/api/Read API is agnostic about what the queryformat.Further note:  In general for query objects that accept strings as attributevalue matches, the store should also support basic filtering capability, such as (match any character) and ? (match single character).  An example query that is a query objectwould be like: { attrFoo: "value"}.  Which generally means match all items where they havean attribute named attrFoo, with a value that starts with 'value'.The queryOptions parameterThe queryOptions parameter is an optional parameter used to specify options that may modifythe query in some fashion, such as doing a case insensitive search, or doing a deep searchwhere all items in a hierarchical representation of data are scanned instead of just the rootitems.  It currently defines two options that all datastores should attempt to honor if possible:{    ignoreCase: boolean, // Whether or not the query should match case sensitively or not.  Default behaviour is false.    deep: boolean   // Whether or not a fetch should do a deep search of items and all child                    // items instead of just root-level items in a datastore.  Default is false.}The onBegin parameter.function(size, request);If an onBegin callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, before the first onItem callback is called.The onBegin callback function will be passed two arguments, thethe total number of items identified and the Request object.  If the total number isunknown, then size will be -1.  Note that size is not necessarily the size of thecollection of items returned from the query, as the request may have specified to return only asubset of the total set of items through the use of the start and count parameters.The onItem parameter.function(item, request);If an onItem callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called as each item in the result is received. The callbackfunction will be passed two arguments: the item itself, and theRequest object.The onComplete parameter.function(items, request);If an onComplete callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, after the last onItem callback is called.Note that if the onItem callback is not present, then onComplete will be passedan array containing all items which matched the query and the request object.If the onItem callback is present, then onComplete is called as:onComplete(null, request).The onError parameter.function(errorData, request);If an onError callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called if there is any sort of error while attempting toexecute the query.The onError callback function will be passed two arguments:an Error object and the Request object.The scope parameter.If a scope object is provided, all of the callback functions (onItem,onComplete, onError, etc) will be invoked in the context of the scopeobject.  In the body of the callback function, the value of the "this"keyword will be the scope object.   If no scope object is provided,the callback functions will be called in the context of dojo.global().For example, onItem.call(scope, item, request) vs.onItem.call(dojo.global(), item, request)The start parameter.If a start parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly start returning items once the start number of items have been located andskipped.  When this parameter is paired with 'count', the store should be ableto page across queries with millions of hits by only returning subsets of thehits for each queryThe count parameter.If a count parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly return up to that many items.  This allows a fetch call that may havemillions of item matches to be paired down to something reasonable.The sort parameter.If a sort parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore tosort the items in some manner before returning the items.  The array is an array ofjavascript objects that must conform to the following format to be applied to thefetching of items:{    attribute: attribute || attribute-name-string,    descending: true|false;   // Optional.  Default is false.}Note that when comparing attributes, if an item contains no value for the attribute(undefined), then it the default ascending sort logic should push it to the bottomof the list.  In the descending order case, it such items should appear at the top of the list.

                 * The basic request is nothing more than the keyword args passed to fetch and

                 * to cancel a fetch.  All data items returns are passed through the callbacks defined in the
                 * fetch parameters and are not present on the 'request' object.

                 * This does not mean that custom stores can not add methods and properties to the request object
                 * returned, only that the API does not require it.  For more info about the Request API,

                 * @param keywordArgs The keywordArgs parameter may either be an instance ofconforming to dojo/data/api/Request or may be a simple anonymous objectthat may contain any of the following:{    query: query-object or query-string,    queryOptions: object,    onBegin: Function,    onItem: Function,    onComplete: Function,    onError: Function,    scope: object,    start: int    count: int    sort: array}All implementations should accept keywordArgs objects with any ofthe 9 standard properties: query, onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onErrorscope, sort, start, and count.  Some implementations may accept additionalproperties in the keywordArgs object as valid parameters, such as{includeOutliers:true}.The query parameterThe query may be optional in some data store implementations.The dojo/data/api/Read API does not specify the syntax or semanticsof the query itself -- each different data store implementationmay have its own notion of what a query should look like.However, as of dojo 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1, all the provided datastores in dojo.dataand dojox.data support an object structure query, where the object is a set ofname/value parameters such as { attrFoo: valueBar, attrFoo1: valueBar1}.  Most of thedijit widgets, such as ComboBox assume this to be the case when working with a datastorewhen they dynamically update the query.  Therefore, for maximum compatibility with dijitwidgets the recommended query parameter is a key/value object.  That does not mean that thethe datastore may not take alternative query forms, such as a simple string, a Date, a number,or a mix of such.  Ultimately, The dojo/data/api/Read API is agnostic about what the queryformat.Further note:  In general for query objects that accept strings as attributevalue matches, the store should also support basic filtering capability, such as (match any character) and ? (match single character).  An example query that is a query objectwould be like: { attrFoo: "value"}.  Which generally means match all items where they havean attribute named attrFoo, with a value that starts with 'value'.The queryOptions parameterThe queryOptions parameter is an optional parameter used to specify options that may modifythe query in some fashion, such as doing a case insensitive search, or doing a deep searchwhere all items in a hierarchical representation of data are scanned instead of just the rootitems.  It currently defines two options that all datastores should attempt to honor if possible:{    ignoreCase: boolean, // Whether or not the query should match case sensitively or not.  Default behaviour is false.    deep: boolean   // Whether or not a fetch should do a deep search of items and all child                    // items instead of just root-level items in a datastore.  Default is false.}The onBegin parameter.function(size, request);If an onBegin callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, before the first onItem callback is called.The onBegin callback function will be passed two arguments, thethe total number of items identified and the Request object.  If the total number isunknown, then size will be -1.  Note that size is not necessarily the size of thecollection of items returned from the query, as the request may have specified to return only asubset of the total set of items through the use of the start and count parameters.The onItem parameter.function(item, request);If an onItem callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called as each item in the result is received. The callbackfunction will be passed two arguments: the item itself, and theRequest object.The onComplete parameter.function(items, request);If an onComplete callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, after the last onItem callback is called.Note that if the onItem callback is not present, then onComplete will be passedan array containing all items which matched the query and the request object.If the onItem callback is present, then onComplete is called as:onComplete(null, request).The onError parameter.function(errorData, request);If an onError callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called if there is any sort of error while attempting toexecute the query.The onError callback function will be passed two arguments:an Error object and the Request object.The scope parameter.If a scope object is provided, all of the callback functions (onItem,onComplete, onError, etc) will be invoked in the context of the scopeobject.  In the body of the callback function, the value of the "this"keyword will be the scope object.   If no scope object is provided,the callback functions will be called in the context of dojo.global().For example, onItem.call(scope, item, request) vs.onItem.call(dojo.global(), item, request)The start parameter.If a start parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly start returning items once the start number of items have been located andskipped.  When this parameter is paired with 'count', the store should be ableto page across queries with millions of hits by only returning subsets of thehits for each queryThe count parameter.If a count parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly return up to that many items.  This allows a fetch call that may havemillions of item matches to be paired down to something reasonable.The sort parameter.If a sort parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore tosort the items in some manner before returning the items.  The array is an array ofjavascript objects that must conform to the following format to be applied to thefetching of items:{    attribute: attribute || attribute-name-string,    descending: true|false;   // Optional.  Default is false.}Note that when comparing attributes, if an item contains no value for the attribute(undefined), then it the default ascending sort logic should push it to the bottomof the list.  In the descending order case, it such items should appear at the top of the list.

Some implementations may accept additionalproperties in the keywordArgs object as valid parameters, such as{includeOutliers:true}.The query parameterThe query may be optional in some data store implementations.The dojo/data/api/Read API does not specify the syntax or semanticsof the query itself -- each different data store implementationmay have its own notion of what a query should look like.However, as of dojo 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1, all the provided datastores in dojo.dataand dojox.data support an object structure query, where the object is a set ofname/value parameters such as { attrFoo: valueBar, attrFoo1: valueBar1}.  Most of thedijit widgets, such as ComboBox assume this to be the case when working with a datastorewhen they dynamically update the query.  Therefore, for maximum compatibility with dijitwidgets the recommended query parameter is a key/value object.  That does not mean that thethe datastore may not take alternative query forms, such as a simple string, a Date, a number,or a mix of such.  Ultimately, The dojo/data/api/Read API is agnostic about what the queryformat.Further note:  In general for query objects that accept strings as attributevalue matches, the store should also support basic filtering capability, such as (match any character) and ? (match single character).  An example query that is a query objectwould be like: { attrFoo: "value"}.  Which generally means match all items where they havean attribute named attrFoo, with a value that starts with 'value'.The queryOptions parameterThe queryOptions parameter is an optional parameter used to specify options that may modifythe query in some fashion, such as doing a case insensitive search, or doing a deep searchwhere all items in a hierarchical representation of data are scanned instead of just the rootitems.  It currently defines two options that all datastores should attempt to honor if possible:{    ignoreCase: boolean, // Whether or not the query should match case sensitively or not.  Default behaviour is false.    deep: boolean   // Whether or not a fetch should do a deep search of items and all child                    // items instead of just root-level items in a datastore.  Default is false.}The onBegin parameter.function(size, request);If an onBegin callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, before the first onItem callback is called.The onBegin callback function will be passed two arguments, thethe total number of items identified and the Request object.  If the total number isunknown, then size will be -1.  Note that size is not necessarily the size of thecollection of items returned from the query, as the request may have specified to return only asubset of the total set of items through the use of the start and count parameters.The onItem parameter.function(item, request);If an onItem callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called as each item in the result is received. The callbackfunction will be passed two arguments: the item itself, and theRequest object.The onComplete parameter.function(items, request);If an onComplete callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, after the last onItem callback is called.Note that if the onItem callback is not present, then onComplete will be passedan array containing all items which matched the query and the request object.If the onItem callback is present, then onComplete is called as:onComplete(null, request).The onError parameter.function(errorData, request);If an onError callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called if there is any sort of error while attempting toexecute the query.The onError callback function will be passed two arguments:an Error object and the Request object.The scope parameter.If a scope object is provided, all of the callback functions (onItem,onComplete, onError, etc) will be invoked in the context of the scopeobject.  In the body of the callback function, the value of the "this"keyword will be the scope object.   If no scope object is provided,the callback functions will be called in the context of dojo.global().For example, onItem.call(scope, item, request) vs.onItem.call(dojo.global(), item, request)The start parameter.If a start parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly start returning items once the start number of items have been located andskipped.  When this parameter is paired with 'count', the store should be ableto page across queries with millions of hits by only returning subsets of thehits for each queryThe count parameter.If a count parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly return up to that many items.  This allows a fetch call that may havemillions of item matches to be paired down to something reasonable.The sort parameter.If a sort parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore tosort the items in some manner before returning the items.  The array is an array ofjavascript objects that must conform to the following format to be applied to thefetching of items:{    attribute: attribute || attribute-name-string,    descending: true|false;   // Optional.  Default is false.}Note that when comparing attributes, if an item contains no value for the attribute(undefined), then it the default ascending sort logic should push it to the bottomof the list.  In the descending order case, it such items should appear at the top of the list.

                 * implements a fetch method that automatically handles eight of the fetch()
                 * arguments -- onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onError, start, count, sort and scope
                 * The class mixing in simpleFetch should not implement fetch(),
                 * but should instead implement a _fetchItems() method.  The _fetchItems()
                 * method takes three arguments, the keywordArgs object that was passed
                 * to fetch(), a callback function to be called when the result array is
                 * available, and an error callback to be called if something goes wrong.
                 * The _fetchItems() method should ignore any keywordArgs parameters for
                 * start, count, onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onError, sort, and scope.
                 * The _fetchItems() method needs to correctly handle any other keywordArgs
                 * parameters, including the query parameter and any optional parameters
                 * (such as includeChildren).  The _fetchItems() method should create an array of
                 * result items and pass it to the fetchHandler along with the original request object --
                 * or, the _fetchItems() method may, if it wants to, create an new request object
                 * with other specifics about the request that are specific to the datastore and pass
                 * that as the request object to the handler.
                 * 
                 * For more information on this specific function, see dojo/data/api/Read.fetch()
                 * 
                 * @param request               OptionalThe keywordArgs parameter may either be an instance ofconforming to dojo/data/api/Request or may be a simple anonymous objectthat may contain any of the following:{    query: query-object or query-string,    queryOptions: object,    onBegin: Function,    onItem: Function,    onComplete: Function,    onError: Function,    scope: object,    start: int    count: int    sort: array}All implementations should accept keywordArgs objects with any ofthe 9 standard properties: query, onBegin, onItem, onComplete, onErrorscope, sort, start, and count.  Some implementations may accept additionalproperties in the keywordArgs object as valid parameters, such as{includeOutliers:true}.The query parameterThe query may be optional in some data store implementations.The dojo/data/api/Read API does not specify the syntax or semanticsof the query itself -- each different data store implementationmay have its own notion of what a query should look like.However, as of dojo 0.9, 1.0, and 1.1, all the provided datastores in dojo.dataand dojox.data support an object structure query, where the object is a set ofname/value parameters such as { attrFoo: valueBar, attrFoo1: valueBar1}.  Most of thedijit widgets, such as ComboBox assume this to be the case when working with a datastorewhen they dynamically update the query.  Therefore, for maximum compatibility with dijitwidgets the recommended query parameter is a key/value object.  That does not mean that thethe datastore may not take alternative query forms, such as a simple string, a Date, a number,or a mix of such.  Ultimately, The dojo/data/api/Read API is agnostic about what the queryformat.Further note:  In general for query objects that accept strings as attributevalue matches, the store should also support basic filtering capability, such as (match any character) and ? (match single character).  An example query that is a query objectwould be like: { attrFoo: "value"}.  Which generally means match all items where they havean attribute named attrFoo, with a value that starts with 'value'.The queryOptions parameterThe queryOptions parameter is an optional parameter used to specify options that may modifythe query in some fashion, such as doing a case insensitive search, or doing a deep searchwhere all items in a hierarchical representation of data are scanned instead of just the rootitems.  It currently defines two options that all datastores should attempt to honor if possible:{    ignoreCase: boolean, // Whether or not the query should match case sensitively or not.  Default behaviour is false.    deep: boolean   // Whether or not a fetch should do a deep search of items and all child                    // items instead of just root-level items in a datastore.  Default is false.}The onBegin parameter.function(size, request);If an onBegin callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, before the first onItem callback is called.The onBegin callback function will be passed two arguments, thethe total number of items identified and the Request object.  If the total number isunknown, then size will be -1.  Note that size is not necessarily the size of thecollection of items returned from the query, as the request may have specified to return only asubset of the total set of items through the use of the start and count parameters.The onItem parameter.function(item, request);If an onItem callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called as each item in the result is received. The callbackfunction will be passed two arguments: the item itself, and theRequest object.The onComplete parameter.function(items, request);If an onComplete callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called just once, after the last onItem callback is called.Note that if the onItem callback is not present, then onComplete will be passedan array containing all items which matched the query and the request object.If the onItem callback is present, then onComplete is called as:onComplete(null, request).The onError parameter.function(errorData, request);If an onError callback function is provided, the callback functionwill be called if there is any sort of error while attempting toexecute the query.The onError callback function will be passed two arguments:an Error object and the Request object.The scope parameter.If a scope object is provided, all of the callback functions (onItem,onComplete, onError, etc) will be invoked in the context of the scopeobject.  In the body of the callback function, the value of the "this"keyword will be the scope object.   If no scope object is provided,the callback functions will be called in the context of dojo.global().For example, onItem.call(scope, item, request) vs.onItem.call(dojo.global(), item, request)The start parameter.If a start parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly start returning items once the start number of items have been located andskipped.  When this parameter is paired with 'count', the store should be ableto page across queries with millions of hits by only returning subsets of thehits for each queryThe count parameter.If a count parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore toonly return up to that many items.  This allows a fetch call that may havemillions of item matches to be paired down to something reasonable.The sort parameter.If a sort parameter is specified, this is a indication to the datastore tosort the items in some manner before returning the items.  The array is an array ofjavascript objects that must conform to the following format to be applied to thefetching of items:{    attribute: attribute || attribute-name-string,    descending: true|false;   // Optional.  Default is false.}Note that when comparing attributes, if an item contains no value for the attribute(undefined), then it the default ascending sort logic should push it to the bottomof the list.  In the descending order case, it such items should appear at the top of the list.

See notes for jsonp property.jsonp (String): The URL parameter name that indicates the JSONP callback string.For instance, when using Yahoo JSONP calls it is normally,jsonp: "callback". For AOL JSONP calls it is normallyjsonp: "c".checkString (String): A string of JavaScript that when evaluated like so:"typeof(" + checkString + ") != 'undefined'"being true means that the script fetched has been loaded.Do not use this if doing a JSONP type of call (use callbackParamName instead).frameDoc (Document): The Document object for a child iframe. If this is passed in, the scriptwill be attached to that document. This can be helpful in some comet long-pollingscenarios with Firefox and Opera.load: This function will becalled on a successful HTTP response code.error: This function willbe called when the request fails due to a network or server error, the urlis invalid, etc. It will also be called if the load or handle callback throws anexception, unless djConfig.debugAtAllCosts is true.  This allows deployed applicationsto continue to run even when a logic error happens in the callback, while makingit easier to troubleshoot while in debug mode.handle: This function willbe called at the end of every request, whether or not an error occurs.url (String): URL to server endpoint.content (Object, optional): Contains properties with string values. Theseproperties will be serialized as name1=value2 andpassed in the request.timeout (Integer, optional): Milliseconds to wait for the response. If this timepasses, the then error callbacks are called.form (DOMNode, optional): DOM node for a form. Used to extract the form valuesand send to the server.preventCache (Boolean, optional): Default is false. If true, then a"dojo.preventCache" parameter is sent in the requestwith a value that changes with each request(timestamp). Useful only with GET-type requests.handleAs (String, optional): Acceptable values depend on the type of IOtransport (see specific IO calls for more information).rawBody (String, optional): Sets the raw body for an HTTP request. If this is used, then the contentproperty is ignored. This is mostly useful for HTTP methods that havea body to their requests, like PUT or POST. This property can be used insteadof postData and putData for dojo/_base/xhr.rawXhrPost and dojo/_base/xhr.rawXhrPut respectively.ioPublish (Boolean, optional): Set this explicitly to false to prevent publishing of topics related toIO operations. Otherwise, if djConfig.ioPublish is set to true, topicswill be published via dojo/topic.publish() for different phases of an IO operation.See dojo/main.__IoPublish for a list of topics that are published.

         * #foo style ID selectors
         * * universal selector
         * ~, the preceded-by sibling selector
         * +, the immediately preceded-by sibling selector
         * attribute queries:
         * [foo] attribute presence selector
         * [foo='bar'] attribute value exact match
         * [foo~='bar'] attribute value list item match
         * [foo^='bar'] attribute start match
         * [foo$='bar'] attribute end match
         * [foo*='bar'] attribute substring match
         * 
         * :first-child, :last-child, and :only-child positional selectors
         * :empty content emtpy selector
         * :checked pseudo selector
         * :nth-child(n), :nth-child(2n+1) style positional calculations
         * :nth-child(even), :nth-child(odd) positional selectors
         * :not(...) negation pseudo selectors
         * Any legal combination of these selectors will work with
         * dojo.query(), including compound selectors ("," delimited).
         * Very complex and useful searches can be constructed with this
         * palette of selectors and when combined with functions for
         * manipulation presented by dojo/NodeList, many types of DOM
         * manipulation operations become very straightforward.
         * 
         * Unsupported Selectors:
         * While dojo.query handles many CSS3 selectors, some fall outside of
         * what's reasonable for a programmatic node querying engine to
         * handle. Currently unsupported selectors include:
         * 
         * namespace-differentiated selectors of any form
         * all :: pseduo-element selectors
         * certain pseudo-selectors which don't get a lot of day-to-day use:
         * :root, :lang(), :target, :focus
         * 
         * all visual and state selectors:
         * :root, :active, :hover, :visited, :link,`:enabled`, `:disabled`
         * :*-of-type pseudo selectors
         * 
         * dojo.query and XML Documents:
         * dojo.query (as of dojo 1.2) supports searching XML documents
         * in a case-sensitive manner. If an HTML document is served with
         * a doctype that forces case-sensitivity (e.g., XHTML 1.1
         * Strict), dojo.query() will detect this and "do the right
         * thing". Case sensitivity is dependent upon the document being
         * searched and not the query used. It is therefore possible to
         * use case-sensitive queries on strict sub-documents (iframes,
         * etc.) or XML documents while still assuming case-insensitivity
         * for a host/root document.
         * 
         * Non-selector Queries:
         * If something other than a String is passed for the query,
         * dojo.query will return a new dojo/NodeList instance
         * constructed from that parameter alone and all further

         * To load a bundle means to insert the bundle into the plugin's cache and publish the bundle
         * value to the loader. Given , , and a particular , the cache key
         * 
         * <path>/nls/<bundle>/<locale>
         * will hold the value. Similarly, then plugin will publish this value to the loader by
         * 
         * define("<path>/nls/<bundle>/<locale>", <bundle-value>);
         * Given this algorithm, other machinery can provide fast load paths be preplacing
         * values in the plugin's cache, which is public. When a load is demanded the
         * cache is inspected before starting any loading. Explicitly placing values in the plugin
         * cache is an advanced/experimental feature that should not be needed; use at your own risk.
         * 
         * For the normal AMD algorithm, the root bundle is loaded first, which instructs the
         * plugin what additional localized bundles are required for a particular locale. These
         * additional locales are loaded and a mix of the root and each progressively-specific
         * locale is returned. For example:
         * 
         * The client demands "dojo/i18n!some/path/nls/someBundle
         * The loader demands load(some/path/nls/someBundle)
         * This plugin require's "some/path/nls/someBundle", which is the root bundle.
         * Assuming config.locale is "ab-cd-ef" and the root bundle indicates that localizations
         * are available for "ab" and "ab-cd-ef" (note the missing "ab-cd", then the plugin
         * requires "some/path/nls/ab/someBundle" and "some/path/nls/ab-cd-ef/someBundle"
         * Upon receiving all required bundles, the plugin constructs the value of the bundle
         * ab-cd-ef as...
         *  mixin(mixin(mixin({}, require("some/path/nls/someBundle"),
         *      require("some/path/nls/ab/someBundle")),
         *      require("some/path/nls/ab-cd-ef/someBundle"));
         * 
         * This value is inserted into the cache and published to the loader at the
         * key/module-id some/path/nls/someBundle/ab-cd-ef.
         * 
         * The special preload signature (case 3) instructs the plugin to stop servicing all normal requests
         * (further preload requests will be serviced) until all ongoing preloading has completed.
         * 
         * The preload signature instructs the plugin that a special rollup module is available that contains
         * one or more flattened, localized bundles. The JSON array of available locales indicates which locales
         * are available. Here is an example:
         * 
         * *preload*some/path/nls/someModule*["root", "ab", "ab-cd-ef"]
         * This indicates the following rollup modules are available:
         * 
         * some/path/nls/someModule_ROOT
         * some/path/nls/someModule_ab
         * some/path/nls/someModule_ab-cd-ef
         * Each of these modules is a normal AMD module that contains one or more flattened bundles in a hash.
         * For example, assume someModule contained the bundles some/bundle/path/someBundle and
         * some/bundle/path/someOtherBundle, then some/path/nls/someModule_ab would be expressed as follows:
         * 
         * define({
         *     some/bundle/path/someBundle:<value of someBundle, flattened with respect to locale ab>,
         *     some/bundle/path/someOtherBundle:<value of someOtherBundle, flattened with respect to locale ab>,
         * });
         * E.g., given this design, preloading for locale=="ab" can execute the following algorithm:
         * 
         * require(["some/path/nls/someModule_ab"], function(rollup){
         *     for(var p in rollup){
         *         var id = p + "/ab",
         *         cache[id] = rollup[p];
         *         define(id, rollup[p]);
         *     }
         * });
         * Similarly, if "ab-cd" is requested, the algorithm can determine that "ab" is the best available and
         * load accordingly.
         * 
         * The builder will write such rollups for every layer if a non-empty localeList  profile property is
         * provided. Further, the builder will include the following cache entry in the cache associated with
         * any layer.
         * 
         * "*now":function(r){r(['dojo/i18n!*preload*<path>/nls/<module>*<JSON array of available locales>']);}
         * The *now special cache module instructs the loader to apply the provided function to context-require
         * with respect to the particular layer being defined. This causes the plugin to hold all normal service
         * requests until all preloading is complete.
         * 
         * Notice that this algorithm is rarely better than the standard AMD load algorithm. Consider the normal case
         * where the target locale has a single segment and a layer depends on a single bundle:
         * 
         * Without Preloads:
         * 
         * Layer loads root bundle.
         * bundle is demanded; plugin loads single localized bundle.
         * With Preloads:
         * 
         * Layer causes preloading of target bundle.
         * bundle is demanded; service is delayed until preloading complete; bundle is returned.
         * In each case a single transaction is required to load the target bundle. In cases where multiple bundles
         * are required and/or the locale has multiple segments, preloads still requires a single transaction whereas
         * the normal path requires an additional transaction for each additional bundle/locale-segment. However all
         * of these additional transactions can be done concurrently. Owing to this analysis, the entire preloading
         * algorithm can be discard during a build by setting the has feature dojo-preload-i18n-Api to false.

         * Deprecated.   This module defines the legacy dojo/_base/Deferred API.
         * New code should use dojo/Deferred instead.
         * The Deferred API is based on the concept of promises that provide a
         * generic interface into the eventual completion of an asynchronous action.
         * The motivation for promises fundamentally is about creating a
         * separation of concerns that allows one to achieve the same type of
         * call patterns and logical data flow in asynchronous code as can be
         * achieved in synchronous code. Promises allows one
         * to be able to call a function purely with arguments needed for
         * execution, without conflating the call with concerns of whether it is
         * sync or async. One shouldn't need to alter a call's arguments if the
         * implementation switches from sync to async (or vice versa). By having
         * async functions return promises, the concerns of making the call are
         * separated from the concerns of asynchronous interaction (which are
         * handled by the promise).
         * 
         * The Deferred is a type of promise that provides methods for fulfilling the
         * promise with a successful result or an error. The most important method for
         * working with Dojo's promises is the then() method, which follows the
         * CommonJS proposed promise API. An example of using a Dojo promise:
         * 
         * var resultingPromise = someAsyncOperation.then(function(result){
         *     ... handle result ...
         * },
         * function(error){
         *     ... handle error ...
         * });
         * The .then() call returns a new promise that represents the result of the
         * execution of the callback. The callbacks will never affect the original promises value.
         * 
         * The Deferred instances also provide the following functions for backwards compatibility:
         * 
         * addCallback(handler)
         * addErrback(handler)
         * callback(result)
         * errback(result)
         * Callbacks are allowed to return promises themselves, so
         * you can build complicated sequences of events with ease.
         * 
         * The creator of the Deferred may specify a canceller.  The canceller
         * is a function that will be called if Deferred.cancel is called
         * before the Deferred fires. You can use this to implement clean
         * aborting of an XMLHttpRequest, etc. Note that cancel will fire the
         * deferred with a CancelledError (unless your canceller returns
         * another kind of error), so the errbacks should be prepared to
         * handle that error for cancellable Deferreds.

         * loads a Javascript module from the appropriate URI
         * Modules are loaded via dojo.require by using one of two loaders: the normal loader
         * and the xdomain loader. The xdomain loader is used when dojo was built with a
         * custom build that specified loader=xdomain and the module lives on a modulePath
         * that is a whole URL, with protocol and a domain. The versions of Dojo that are on
         * the Google and AOL CDNs use the xdomain loader.
         * 
         * If the module is loaded via the xdomain loader, it is an asynchronous load, since
         * the module is added via a dynamically created script tag. This
         * means that dojo.require() can return before the module has loaded. However, this
         * should only happen in the case where you do dojo.require calls in the top-level
         * HTML page, or if you purposely avoid the loader checking for dojo.require
         * dependencies in your module by using a syntax like dojo["require"] to load the module.
         * 
         * Sometimes it is useful to not have the loader detect the dojo.require calls in the
         * module so that you can dynamically load the modules as a result of an action on the
         * page, instead of right at module load time.
         * 
         * Also, for script blocks in an HTML page, the loader does not pre-process them, so
         * it does not know to download the modules before the dojo.require calls occur.
         * 
         * So, in those two cases, when you want on-the-fly module loading or for script blocks
         * in the HTML page, special care must be taken if the dojo.required code is loaded
         * asynchronously. To make sure you can execute code that depends on the dojo.required
         * modules, be sure to add the code that depends on the modules in a dojo.addOnLoad()
         * callback. dojo.addOnLoad waits for all outstanding modules to finish loading before
         * executing.
         * 
         * This type of syntax works with both xdomain and normal loaders, so it is good
         * practice to always use this idiom for on-the-fly code loading and in HTML script
         * blocks. If at some point you change loaders and where the code is loaded from,
         * it will all still work.
         * 
         * More on how dojo.require
         * dojo.require("A.B") first checks to see if symbol A.B is
         * defined. If it is, it is simply returned (nothing to do).
         * 
         * If it is not defined, it will look for A/B.js in the script root
         * directory.
         * 
         * dojo.require throws an exception if it cannot find a file
         * to load, or if the symbol A.B is not defined after loading.
         * 
         * It returns the object A.B, but note the caveats above about on-the-fly loading and
         * HTML script blocks when the xdomain loader is loading a module.
         * 
         * dojo.require() does nothing about importing symbols into
         * the current namespace.  It is presumed that the caller will
         * take care of that.
         * 
         * @param moduleName module name to load, using periods for separators, e.g. "dojo.date.locale".  Module paths are de-referenced by dojo'sinternal mapping of locations to names and are disambiguated bylongest prefix. See dojo.registerModulePath() for details onregistering new modules.             
         * @param omitModuleCheck               Optionalif true, omitModuleCheck skips the step of ensuring that theloaded file actually defines the symbol it is referenced by.For example if it called as dojo.require("a.b.c") and thefile located at a/b/c.js does not define an object a.b.c,and exception will be throws whereas no exception is raisedwhen called as dojo.require("a.b.c", true)

             * normalize. In case 3, it  is assumed to be absolute; this is arranged by the builder.
             * 
             * To load a bundle means to insert the bundle into the plugin's cache and publish the bundle
             * value to the loader. Given , , and a particular , the cache key
             * 
             * <path>/nls/<bundle>/<locale>
             * will hold the value. Similarly, then plugin will publish this value to the loader by
             * 
             * define("<path>/nls/<bundle>/<locale>", <bundle-value>);
             * Given this algorithm, other machinery can provide fast load paths be preplacing
             * values in the plugin's cache, which is public. When a load is demanded the
             * cache is inspected before starting any loading. Explicitly placing values in the plugin
             * cache is an advanced/experimental feature that should not be needed; use at your own risk.
             * 
             * For the normal AMD algorithm, the root bundle is loaded first, which instructs the
             * plugin what additional localized bundles are required for a particular locale. These
             * additional locales are loaded and a mix of the root and each progressively-specific
             * locale is returned. For example:
             * 
             * The client demands "dojo/i18n!some/path/nls/someBundle
             * The loader demands load(some/path/nls/someBundle)
             * This plugin require's "some/path/nls/someBundle", which is the root bundle.
             * Assuming config.locale is "ab-cd-ef" and the root bundle indicates that localizations
             * are available for "ab" and "ab-cd-ef" (note the missing "ab-cd", then the plugin
             * requires "some/path/nls/ab/someBundle" and "some/path/nls/ab-cd-ef/someBundle"
             * Upon receiving all required bundles, the plugin constructs the value of the bundle
             * ab-cd-ef as...
             *  mixin(mixin(mixin({}, require("some/path/nls/someBundle"),
             *      require("some/path/nls/ab/someBundle")),
             *      require("some/path/nls/ab-cd-ef/someBundle"));
             * 
             * This value is inserted into the cache and published to the loader at the
             * key/module-id some/path/nls/someBundle/ab-cd-ef.
             * 
             * The special preload signature (case 3) instructs the plugin to stop servicing all normal requests
             * (further preload requests will be serviced) until all ongoing preloading has completed.
             * 
             * The preload signature instructs the plugin that a special rollup module is available that contains
             * one or more flattened, localized bundles. The JSON array of available locales indicates which locales
             * are available. Here is an example:
             * 
             * *preload*some/path/nls/someModule*["root", "ab", "ab-cd-ef"]
             * This indicates the following rollup modules are available:
             * 
             * some/path/nls/someModule_ROOT
             * some/path/nls/someModule_ab
             * some/path/nls/someModule_ab-cd-ef
             * Each of these modules is a normal AMD module that contains one or more flattened bundles in a hash.
             * For example, assume someModule contained the bundles some/bundle/path/someBundle and
             * some/bundle/path/someOtherBundle, then some/path/nls/someModule_ab would be expressed as follows:
             * 
             * define({
             *     some/bundle/path/someBundle:<value of someBundle, flattened with respect to locale ab>,
             *     some/bundle/path/someOtherBundle:<value of someOtherBundle, flattened with respect to locale ab>,
             * });
             * E.g., given this design, preloading for locale=="ab" can execute the following algorithm:
             * 
             * require(["some/path/nls/someModule_ab"], function(rollup){
             *     for(var p in rollup){
             *         var id = p + "/ab",
             *         cache[id] = rollup[p];
             *         define(id, rollup[p]);
             *     }
             * });
             * Similarly, if "ab-cd" is requested, the algorithm can determine that "ab" is the best available and
             * load accordingly.
             * 
             * The builder will write such rollups for every layer if a non-empty localeList  profile property is
             * provided. Further, the builder will include the following cache entry in the cache associated with
             * any layer.
             * 
             * "*now":function(r){r(['dojo/i18n!*preload*<path>/nls/<module>*<JSON array of available locales>']);}
             * The *now special cache module instructs the loader to apply the provided function to context-require
             * with respect to the particular layer being defined. This causes the plugin to hold all normal service
             * requests until all preloading is complete.
             * 
             * Notice that this algorithm is rarely better than the standard AMD load algorithm. Consider the normal case
             * where the target locale has a single segment and a layer depends on a single bundle:
             * 
             * Without Preloads:
             * 
             * Layer loads root bundle.
             * bundle is demanded; plugin loads single localized bundle.
             * With Preloads:
             * 
             * Layer causes preloading of target bundle.
             * bundle is demanded; service is delayed until preloading complete; bundle is returned.
             * In each case a single transaction is required to load the target bundle. In cases where multiple bundles
             * are required and/or the locale has multiple segments, preloads still requires a single transaction whereas
             * the normal path requires an additional transaction for each additional bundle/locale-segment. However all
             * of these additional transactions can be done concurrently. Owing to this analysis, the entire preloading
             * algorithm can be discard during a build by setting the has feature dojo-preload-i18n-Api to false.
