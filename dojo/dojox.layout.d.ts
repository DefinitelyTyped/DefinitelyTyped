             * DOM node innerHTML
             *   title: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerHTML" }
             * Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerHTML
             *
             * DOM node innerText
             *   title: { node: "titleNode", type: "innerText" }
             * Maps this.title to this.titleNode.innerText

This allows deployed applicationsto continue to run even when a logic error happens in the callback, while makingit easier to troubleshoot while in debug mode.handle: This function willbe called at the end of every request, whether or not an error occurs.url (String): URL to server endpoint.content (Object, optional): Contains properties with string values. Theseproperties will be serialized as name1=value2 andpassed in the request.timeout (Integer, optional): Milliseconds to wait for the response. If this timepasses, the then error callbacks are called.form (DOMNode, optional): DOM node for a form. Used to extract the form valuesand send to the server.preventCache (Boolean, optional): Default is false. If true, then a"dojo.preventCache" parameter is sent in the requestwith a value that changes with each request(timestamp). Useful only with GET-type requests.rawBody (String, optional): Sets the raw body for an HTTP request. If this is used, then the contentproperty is ignored. This is mostly useful for HTTP methods that havea body to their requests, like PUT or POST. This property can be used insteadof postData and putData for dojo/_base/xhr.rawXhrPost and dojo/_base/xhr.rawXhrPut respectively.ioPublish (Boolean, optional): Set this explicitly to false to prevent publishing of topics related toIO operations.

Indicates whether the request shouldbe a synchronous (blocking) request.headers (Object, optional): Additional HTTP headers to send in the request.failOk (Boolean, optional): false is default. Indicates whether a request should beallowed to fail (and therefore no console error message inthe event of a failure)contentType (String|Boolean): "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" is default. Set to false toprevent a Content-Type header from being sent, or to a stringto send a different Content-Type.load: This function will becalled on a successful HTTP response code.error: This function willbe called when the request fails due to a network or server error, the urlis invalid, etc. It will also be called if the load or handle callback throws anexception, unless djConfig.debugAtAllCosts is true.  This allows deployed applicationsto continue to run even when a logic error happens in the callback, while makingit easier to troubleshoot while in debug mode.handle: This function willbe called at the end of every request, whether or not an error occurs.url (String): URL to server endpoint.content (Object, optional): Contains properties with string values. Theseproperties will be serialized as name1=value2 andpassed in the request.timeout (Integer, optional): Milliseconds to wait for the response. If this timepasses, the then error callbacks are called.form (DOMNode, optional): DOM node for a form. Used to extract the form valuesand send to the server.preventCache (Boolean, optional): Default is false. If true, then a"dojo.preventCache" parameter is sent in the requestwith a value that changes with each request(timestamp). Useful only with GET-type requests.rawBody (String, optional): Sets the raw body for an HTTP request. If this is used, then the contentproperty is ignored. This is mostly useful for HTTP methods that havea body to their requests, like PUT or POST. This property can be used insteadof postData and putData for dojo/_base/xhr.rawXhrPost and dojo/_base/xhr.rawXhrPut respectively.ioPublish (Boolean, optional): Set this explicitly to false to prevent publishing of topics related toIO operations. Otherwise, if djConfig.ioPublish is set to true, topicswill be published via dojo/topic.publish() for different phases of an IO operation.See dojo/main.__IoPublish for a list of topics that are published.
