  /**
   * Bootstrapping for Angular applications.
   * 
   * You instantiate an Angular application by explicitly specifying a component to use as the root
   * component for your
   * application via the `bootstrap()` method.
   * 
   * ## Simple Example
   * 
   * Assuming this `index.html`:
   * 
   * ```html
   * <html>
   *   <!-- load Angular script tags here. -->
   *   <body>
   *     <my-app>loading...</my-app>
   *   </body>
   * </html>
   * ```
   * 
   * An application is bootstrapped inside an existing browser DOM, typically `index.html`. Unlike
   * Angular 1, Angular 2
   * does not compile/process bindings in `index.html`. This is mainly for security reasons, as well
   * as architectural
   * changes in Angular 2. This means that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side
   * technologies such as
   * bindings. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from Angular 2
   * component double-curly
   * `{{ syntax }}`.
   * 
   * We can use this script code:
   * 
   * ```
   * @Component({
   *    selector: 'my-app'
   * })
   * @View({
   *    template: 'Hello {{ name }}!'
   * })
   * class MyApp {
   *   name:string;
   * 
   *   constructor() {
   *     this.name = 'World';
   *   }
   * }
   * 
   * main() {
   *   return bootstrap(MyApp);
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its argument,
   * Angular performs the
   * following tasks:
   * 
   *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs to be
   * upgraded into
   *     the angular component.
   *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can also
   * override the injector configuration for an app by
   * invoking `bootstrap` with the `componentInjectableBindings` argument.
   *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection domain
   * instance.
   *  4. It creates a shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the template into
   * it.
   *  5. It instantiates the specified component.
   *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data bindings for the
   * application.
   * 
   * 
   * ## Instantiating Multiple Applications on a Single Page
   * 
   * There are two ways to do this.
   * 
   * 
   * ### Isolated Applications
   * 
   * Angular creates a new application each time that the `bootstrap()` method is invoked. When
   * multiple applications
   * are created for a page, Angular treats each application as independent within an isolated change
   * detection and
   * `Zone` domain. If you need to share data between applications, use the strategy described in the
   * next
   * section, "Applications That Share Change Detection."
   * 
   * 
   * ### Applications That Share Change Detection
   * 
   * If you need to bootstrap multiple applications that share common data, the applications must
   * share a common
   * change detection and zone. To do that, create a meta-component that lists the application
   * components in its template.
   * By only invoking the `bootstrap()` method once, with the meta-component as its argument, you
   * ensure that only a
   * single change detection zone is created and therefore data can be shared across the applications.
   * 
   * 
   * ## Platform Injector
   * 
   * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,
   * location, and others.
   * Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be shared across all Angular
   * applications that
   * occupy the same browser window.  For this reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform
   * injector which stores
   * all shared services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its
   * parent.
   * 
   * Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are multiple applications on a
   * page, Angular treats
   * each application injector's services as private to that application.
   * 
   * 
   * # API
   * - `appComponentType`: The root component which should act as the application. This is a reference
   * to a `Type`
   *   which is annotated with `@Component(...)`.
   * - `componentInjectableBindings`: An additional set of bindings that can be added to the app
   * injector
   * to override default injection behavior.
   * - `errorReporter`: `function(exception:any, stackTrace:string)` a default error reporter for
   * unhandled exceptions.
   * 
   * Returns a `Promise` of {@link ApplicationRef}.

  /**
   * Directives allow you to attach behavior to elements in the DOM.
   * 
   * {@link Directive}s with an embedded view are called {@link Component}s.
   * 
   * A directive consists of a single directive annotation and a controller class. When the
   * directive's `selector` matches
   * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:
   * 
   * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor
   * arguments.
   * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a
   * depth-first order,
   *    as declared in the HTML.
   * 
   * ## Understanding How Injection Works
   * 
   * There are three stages of injection resolution.
   * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:
   *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if
   * the dependency was
   *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.
   *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,
   * location, and others.
   * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow
   * the same parent-child hierarchy
   *     as the component instances in the DOM.
   * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each
   * element has an `ElementInjector`
   *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.
   * 
   * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a
   * depth-first order. The
   * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.
   * 
   * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the
   * {@link View}:
   * 
   * 1. Dependencies on the current element
   * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary
   * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component
   * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors
   * 
   * 
   * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can
   * delegate to the parent
   * injector.
   * 
   * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:
   * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only
   * - `@Ancestor() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current
   * element and the
   *    Shadow DOM root. Current element is not included in the resolution, therefore even if it could
   * resolve it, it will
   *    be ignored.
   * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child
   * directives.
   * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any
   * child directives.
   * 
   * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:
   * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.
   * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for
   * {@link Directive} directives only
   * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.
   * 
   * ## Example
   * 
   * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in
   * practice.
   * 
   * 
   * Assume this HTML template:
   * 
   * ```
   * <div dependency="1">
   *   <div dependency="2">
   *     <div dependency="3" my-directive>
   *       <div dependency="4">
   *         <div dependency="5"></div>
   *       </div>
   *       <div dependency="6"></div>
   *     </div>
   *   </div>
   * </div>
   * ```
   * 
   * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.
   * 
   * ```
   * @Injectable()
   * class SomeService {
   * }
   * 
   * @Directive({
   *   selector: '[dependency]',
   *   properties: [
   *     'id: dependency'
   *   ]
   * })
   * class Dependency {
   *   id:string;
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...
   * 
   * 
   * ### No injection
   * 
   * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into
   * `MyDirective`.
   * 
   * ```
   * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
   * class MyDirective {
   *   constructor() {
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.
   * 
   * 
   * ### Component-level injection
   * 
   * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its
   * parents.
   * 
   * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type
   * from the parent
   * component's injector.
   * ```
   * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
   * class MyDirective {
   *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.
   * 
   * 
   * ### Injecting a directive from the current element
   * 
   * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.
   * 
   * ```
   * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
   * class MyDirective {
   *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {
   *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case
   * `dependency="3"`.
   * 
   * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements
   * 
   * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow
   * DOM), i.e. on the
   * parent element and its parents. By definition, a directive with an `@Ancestor` annotation does
   * not attempt to
   * resolve dependencies for the current element, even if this would satisfy the dependency.
   * 
   * ```
   * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
   * class MyDirective {
   *   constructor(@Ancestor() dependency: Dependency) {
   *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * `@Ancestor` checks the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If `dependency="2"` didn't
   * exist on the direct parent, this injection would
   * have returned
   * `dependency="1"`.
   * 
   * 
   * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives
   * 
   * 
   * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated
   * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,
   * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,
   * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ng-for`, an
   * `ng-if`, or an `ng-switch`.
   * 
   * ```
   * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
   * class MyDirective {
   *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and
   * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.
   * 
   * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives
   * 
   * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child
   * elements.
   * 
   * ```
   * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
   * class MyDirective {
   *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.
   * 
   * ### Optional injection
   * 
   * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be
   * resolved. If you
   * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency
   * with `@Optional()`.
   * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as
   * optional.
   * 
   * ```
   * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })
   * class MyDirective {
   *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.
   * If none can be
   * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.
   * 
   * ## Example
   * 
   * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.
   * 
   * ```
   * @Directive({
   *   selector: '[tooltip]',
   *   properties: [
   *     'text: tooltip'
   *   ],
   *   hostListeners: {
   *     'onmouseenter': 'onMouseEnter()',
   *     'onmouseleave': 'onMouseLeave()'
   *   }
   * })
   * class Tooltip{
   *   text:string;
   *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
   *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
   * 
   *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {
   *     this.overlay = overlay;
   *   }
   * 
   *   onMouseEnter() {
   *     // exact signature to be determined
   *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);
   *   }
   * 
   *   onMouseLeave() {
   *     this.overlay.close();
   *     this.overlay = null;
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the
   * `tooltip` selector,
   * like so:
   * 
   * ```
   * <div tooltip="some text here"></div>
   * ```
   * 
   * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template
   * elements:
   * 
   * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at
   * runtime.
   * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a
   * location in the current view
   * where these actions are performed.
   * 
   * Views are always created as children of the current {@link View}, and as siblings of the
   * `<template>` element. Thus a
   * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.
   * 
   * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full
   * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular
   * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo="bar">` and `<li template="foo: bar">` are
   * equivalent.
   * 
   * Thus,
   * 
   * ```
   * <ul>
   *   <li *foo="bar" title="text"></li>
   * </ul>
   * ```
   * 
   * Expands in use to:
   * 
   * ```
   * <ul>
   *   <template [foo]="bar">
   *     <li title="text"></li>
   *   </template>
   * </ul>
   * ```
   * 
   * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo="bar"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for
   * the directive
   * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.
   * 
   * 
   * ## Example
   * 
   * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.
   * 
   * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:
   * 
   * ```
   * @Directive({
   *   selector: '[unless]',
   *   properties: ['unless']
   * })
   * export class Unless {
   *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;
   *   templateRef: TemplateRef;
   *   prevCondition: boolean;
   * 
   *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {
   *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;
   *     this.templateRef = templateRef;
   *     this.prevCondition = null;
   *   }
   * 
   *   set unless(newCondition) {
   *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {
   *       this.prevCondition = true;
   *       this.viewContainer.clear();
   *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {
   *       this.prevCondition = false;
   *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);
   *     }
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:
   * ```
   * <ul>
   *   <li *unless="expr"></li>
   * </ul>
   * ```
   * 
   * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands
   * and the result is:
   * 
   * ```
   * <ul>
   *   <template [unless]="exp">
   *     <li></li>
   *   </template>
   *   <li></li>
   * </ul>
   * ```
   * 
   * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,
   * the instantiated
   * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.

     * 
     * Angular only allows directives to trigger on CSS selectors that do not cross element

     * `selector` may be declared as one of the following:
     * 
     * - `element-name`: select by element name.
     * - `.class`: select by class name.
     * - `[attribute]`: select by attribute name.

     selector: string;
    

    /**
     * Enumerates the set of properties that accept data binding for a directive.
     * 
     * The `properties` property defines a set of `directiveProperty` to `bindingProperty`
     * configuration:
     * 
     * - `directiveProperty` specifies the component property where the value is written.
     * - `bindingProperty` specifies the DOM property where the value is read from.
     * 
     * You can include a {@link Pipe} when specifying a `bindingProperty` to allow for data
     * transformation and structural change detection of the value. These pipes will be evaluated in
     * the context of this component.
     * 
     * ## Syntax
     * 
     * There is no need to specify both `directiveProperty` and `bindingProperty` when they both have
     * the same value.
     * 
     * ```
     * @Directive({
     *   properties: [
     *     'propertyName', // shorthand notation for 'propertyName: propertyName'
     *     'directiveProperty1: bindingProperty1',
     *     'directiveProperty2: bindingProperty2 | pipe1 | ...',
     *     ...
     *   ]
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * 
     * ## Basic Property Binding
     * 
     * We can easily build a simple `Tooltip` directive that exposes a `tooltip` property, which can
     * be used in templates with standard Angular syntax. For example:
     * 
     * ```
     * @Directive({
     *   selector: '[tooltip]',
     *   properties: [
     *     'text: tooltip'
     *   ]
     * })
     * class Tooltip {
     *   set text(value: string) {
     *     // This will get called every time with the new value when the 'tooltip' property changes
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * We can then bind to the `tooltip' property as either an expression (`someExpression`) or as a
     * string literal, as shown in the HTML template below:
     * 
     * ```html
     * <div [tooltip]="someExpression">...</div>
     * <div tooltip="Some Text">...</div>
     * ```
     * 
     * Whenever the `someExpression` expression changes, the `properties` declaration instructs
     * Angular to update the `Tooltip`'s `text` property.
     * 
     * ## Bindings With Pipes
     * 
     * You can also use pipes when writing binding definitions for a directive.
     * 
     * For example, we could write a binding that updates the directive on structural changes, rather
     * than on reference changes, as normally occurs in change detection.
     * 
     * See {@link Pipe} and {@link KeyValueChanges} documentation for more details.
     * 
     * ```
     * @Directive({
     *   selector: '[class-set]',
     *   properties: [
     *     'classChanges: classSet | keyValDiff'
     *   ]
     * })
     * class ClassSet {
     *   set classChanges(changes: KeyValueChanges) {
     *     // This will get called every time the `class-set` expressions changes its structure.
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * The template that this directive is used in may also contain its own pipes. For example:
     * 
     * ```html
     * <div [class-set]="someExpression | somePipe">
     * ```
     * 
     * In this case, the two pipes compose as if they were inlined: `someExpression | somePipe |
     * keyValDiff`.

    /**
     * Specifiy the events, actions, properties and attributes related to the host element.
     * 
     * ## Events
     * 
     * Specifies which DOM hostListeners a directive listens to via a set of `(event)` to `method`
     * key-value pairs:
     * 
     * - `event1`: the DOM event that the directive listens to.
     * - `statement`: the statement to execute when the event occurs.
     * If the evalutation of the statement returns `false`, then `preventDefault`is applied on the DOM
     * event.
     * 
     * To listen to global events, a target must be added to the event name.
     * The target can be `window`, `document` or `body`.
     * 
     * When writing a directive event binding, you can also refer to the following local variables:
     * - `$event`: Current event object which triggered the event.
     * - `$target`: The source of the event. This will be either a DOM element or an Angular
     * directive. (will be implemented in later release)
     * 
     * ## Syntax
     * 
     * ```
     * @Directive({
     *   host: {
     *     '(event1)': 'onMethod1(arguments)',
     *     '(target:event2)': 'onMethod2(arguments)',
     *     ...
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * ## Basic Event Binding:
     * 
     * Suppose you want to write a directive that reacts to `change` events in the DOM and on
     * `resize` events in window.
     * You would define the event binding as follows:
     * 
     * ```
     * @Directive({
     *   selector: 'input',
     *   host: {
     *     '(change)': 'onChange($event)',
     *     '(window:resize)': 'onResize($event)'
     *   }
     * })
     * class InputDirective {
     *   onChange(event:Event) {
     *     // invoked when the input element fires the 'change' event
     *   }
     *   onResize(event:Event) {
     *     // invoked when the window fires the 'resize' event
     *   }
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * ## Properties
     * 
     * Specifies which DOM properties a directives updates.
     * 
     * ## Syntax
     * 
     * ```
     * @Directive({
     *   selector: 'input',
     *   host: {
     *     '[prop]': 'expression'
     *   }
     * })
     * class InputDirective {
     *   value:string;
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * In this example the prop property of the host element is updated with the expression value
     * every time it changes.
     * 
     * ## Attributes
     * 
     * Specifies static attributes that should be propagated to a host element. Attributes specified
     * in `hostAttributes` are propagated only if a given attribute is not present on a host element.
     * 
     * ## Syntax
     * 
     * ```
     * @Directive({
     *   selector: '[my-button]',
     *   host: {
     *     'role': 'button'
     *   }
     * })
     * class MyButton {
     * }
     * ```
     * 
     * In this example using `my-button` directive (ex.: `<div my-button></div>`) on a host element
     * (here: `<div>` ) will ensure that this element will get the "button" role.
     * 
     * ## Actions
     * 
     * Specifies which DOM methods a directive can invoke.
     * 
     * ## Syntax
     * 
     * ```
     * @Directive({

     *   host: {
     *     '@emitFocus': 'focus()'
     *   }

     * 
     *   focus() {
     *     this.emitFocus.next();
     *   }
     * }
     * ```

   * An iterable live list of components in the Light DOM.
   * 
   * Injectable Objects that contains a live list of child directives in the light DOM of a directive.
   * The directives are kept in depth-first pre-order traversal of the DOM.
   * 
   * The `QueryList` is iterable, therefore it can be used in both javascript code with `for..of` loop
   * as well as in
   * template with `*ng-for="of"` directive.
   * 
   * NOTE: In the future this class will implement an `Observable` interface. For now it uses a plain
   * list of observable
   * callbacks.
   * 
   * # Example:
   * 
   * Assume that `<tabs>` component would like to get a list its children which are `<pane>`
   * components as shown in this
   * example:
   * 
   * ```html
   * <tabs>
   *   <pane title="Overview">...</pane>
   *   <pane *ng-for="#o of objects" [title]="o.title">{{o.text}}</pane>
   * </tabs>
   * ```
   * 
   * In the above example the list of `<tabs>` elements needs to get a list of `<pane>` elements so
   * that it could render
   * tabs with the correct titles and in the correct order.
   * 
   * A possible solution would be for a `<pane>` to inject `<tabs>` component and then register itself
   * with `<tabs>`
   * component's on `hydrate` and deregister on `dehydrate` event. While a reasonable approach, this
   * would only work
   * partialy since `*ng-for` could rearrange the list of `<pane>` components which would not be
   * reported to `<tabs>`
   * component and thus the list of `<pane>` components would be out of sync with respect to the list
   * of `<pane>` elements.
   * 
   * A preferred solution is to inject a `QueryList` which is a live list of directives in the
   * component`s light DOM.
   * 
   * ```javascript
   * @Component({
   *   selector: 'tabs'
   * })
   * @View({
   *  template: `
   *    <ul>
   *      <li *ng-for="#pane of panes">{{pane.title}}</li>
   *    </ul>
   *    <content></content>
   *  `
   * })
   * class Tabs {
   *   panes: QueryList<Pane>
   * 
   *   constructor(@Query(Pane) panes:QueryList<Pane>) {
   *     this.panes = panes;
   *   }
   * }
   * 
   * @Component({
   *   selector: 'pane',

  /**
   * A dependency injection container used for resolving dependencies.
   * 
   * An `Injector` is a replacement for a `new` operator, which can automatically resolve the
   * constructor dependencies.
   * In typical use, application code asks for the dependencies in the constructor and they are
   * resolved by the `Injector`.
   * 
   * ## Example:
   * 
   * Suppose that we want to inject an `Engine` into class `Car`, we would define it like this:
   * 
   * ```javascript
   * class Engine {
   * }
   * 
   * class Car {
   *   constructor(@Inject(Engine) engine) {
   *   }
   * }
   * 
   * ```
   * 
   * Next we need to write the code that creates and instantiates the `Injector`. We then ask for the
   * `root` object, `Car`, so that the `Injector` can recursively build all of that object's
   * dependencies.
   * 
   * ```javascript
   * main() {
   *   var injector = Injector.resolveAndCreate([Car, Engine]);
   * 
   *   // Get a reference to the `root` object, which will recursively instantiate the tree.
   *   var car = injector.get(Car);
   * }
   * ```
   * Notice that we don't use the `new` operator because we explicitly want to have the `Injector`
   * resolve all of the object's dependencies automatically.

  /**
   * Performs http requests using `XMLHttpRequest` as the default backend.
   * 
   * `Http` is available as an injectable class, with methods to perform http requests. Calling
   * `request` returns an {@link EventEmitter} which will emit a single {@link Response} when a
   * response is received.
   * 
   * 
   * ## Breaking Change
   * 
   * Previously, methods of `Http` would return an RxJS Observable directly. For now,
   * the `toRx()` method of {@link EventEmitter} needs to be called in order to get the RxJS
   * Subject. `EventEmitter` does not provide combinators like `map`, and has different semantics for
   * subscribing/observing. This is temporary; the result of all `Http` method calls will be either an
   * Observable
   * or Dart Stream when [issue #2794](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/2794) is resolved.
   * 
   * #Example
   * 
   * ```
   * import {Http, httpInjectables} from 'angular2/http';
   * @Component({selector: 'http-app', viewInjector: [httpInjectables]})
   * @View({templateUrl: 'people.html'})
   * class PeopleComponent {
   *   constructor(http: Http) {
   *     http.get('people.json')
   *       //Get the RxJS Subject
   *       .toRx()
   *       // Call map on the response observable to get the parsed people object
   *       .map(res => res.json())
   *       // Subscribe to the observable to get the parsed people object and attach it to the
   *       // component
   *       .subscribe(people => this.people = people);
   *   }
   * }
   * ```
   * 
   * To use the {@link EventEmitter} returned by `Http`, simply pass a generator (See "interface
   * Generator" in the Async Generator spec: https://github.com/jhusain/asyncgenerator) to the
   * `observer` method of the returned emitter, with optional methods of `next`, `throw`, and `return`.
   * 
   * #Example
   * 
   * ```
   * http.get('people.json').observer({next: (value) => this.people = people});
   * ```
   * 
   * The default construct used to perform requests, `XMLHttpRequest`, is abstracted as a "Backend" (
   * {@link XHRBackend} in this case), which could be mocked with dependency injection by replacing
   * the {@link XHRBackend} binding, as in the following example:
   * 
   * #Example
   * 
   * ```
   * import {MockBackend, BaseRequestOptions, Http} from 'angular2/http';
   * var injector = Injector.resolveAndCreate([
   *   BaseRequestOptions,
   *   MockBackend,
   *   bind(Http).toFactory(
   *       function(backend, defaultOptions) {
   *         return new Http(backend, defaultOptions);
   *       },
   *       [MockBackend, BaseRequestOptions])
   * ]);
   * var http = injector.get(Http);
   * http.get('request-from-mock-backend.json').toRx().subscribe((res:Response) => doSomething(res));
   * ```
