	 * It is possible to have multiple loggers in log4javascript. For example, you may wish to have a logger for debugging purposes 
	 * that logs messages to a pop-up window and a separate logger that reports any client-side application errors to the server via Ajax.
	 * From version 1.4, log4javascript has hierarchical loggers, implemented in the same way as log4j. In summary, you specify a 
	 * logger's parent logger by means of a dot between the parent logger name and the child logger name. Therefore the logger 
	 * tim.app.security inherits from tim.app, which in turn inherits from tim which, finally, inherits from the root logger.
	 * What inheritance means for a logger is that in the absence of a threshold level set specifically on the logger it inherits 
	 * its level from its parent; also, a logger inherits all its parent's appenders (this is known as appender additivity in log4j. 
	 * This behaviour can be enabled or disabled via setAdditivity(). See below). In the above example, if the root logger has a 
	 * level of DEBUG and one appender, each of the loggers tim.app.security, tim.app and tim would inherit the root level's appender.
	 * If, say, tim.app's threshold level was set to WARN, tim's effective level would remain at DEBUG (inherited from the root logger) 
	 * while tim.app.security's effective level would be WARN, inherited from tim.app. The important thing to note is that appenders 
	 * accumulate down the logger hierarchy while levels are simply inherited from the nearest ancestor with a threshold level set.
	 * For a detailed explanation of the logger hierarchy, see the log4j manual.
