# TypeScript Definitions #

Reference the `phaser.d.ts` in your project. 

Please use TypeScript 1.4+

- `phaser.d.ts` contains a reference to `pixi.d.ts` and `p2.d.ts` and so both these files must remain siblings in the same directory. 
- `pixi.d.ts` has deviated from the official project. If you are a pixi user, pick up the ball over at [the  official pixi typescript repo](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi-typescript).
