		The string is assumed to be RFC4180-compliant. 
		Unlike the parseRows method, this method requires that the first line of the CSV file contains a comma-separated list of column names; 
		these column names become the attributes on the returned objects. 
		For example, consider the following CSV file:

Year,Make,Model,Length
1997,Ford,E350,2.34
2000,Mercury,Cougar,2.38

The resulting JavaScript array is:

[  {"Year": "1997", "Make": "Ford", "Model": "E350", "Length": "2.34"},
  {"Year": "2000", "Make": "Mercury", "Model": "Cougar", "Length": "2.38"} ]

		/** Parses the specified string, which is the contents of a CSV file, returning an array of arrays representing the parsed rows. The string is assumed to be RFC4180-compliant. Unlike the parse method, this method treats the header line as a standard row, and should be used whenever the CSV file does not contain a header. Each row is represented as an array rather than an object. Rows may have variable length. For example, consider the following CSV file:

1997,Ford,E350,2.34
2000,Mercury,Cougar,2.38
The resulting JavaScript array is:

[  ["1997", "Ford", "E350", "2.34"],
  ["2000", "Mercury", "Cougar", "2.38"] ]
Note that the values themselves are always strings; they will not be automatically converted to numbers. See parse for details.*/
