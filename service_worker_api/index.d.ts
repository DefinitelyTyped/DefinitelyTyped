/**
 * An CacheOptions object allowing you to set specific control options for the
 * matching done in the match operation.
 *
 * @property [ignoreSearch] A Boolean that specifies whether the matching
 * process should ignore the query string in the url.  If set to true,
 * the ?value=bar part of http://foo.com/?value=bar would be ignored when
 * performing a match. It defaults to false.
 *
 * @property [ignoreMethod] A Boolean that, when set to true, prevents matching
 * operations from validating the Request http method (normally only GET
 * and HEAD are allowed.) It defaults to false.
 *
 * @property [ignoreVary] A Boolean that when set to true tells the matching
 * operation not to perform VARY header matching â€” i.e. if the URL matches you
 * will get a match regardless of the Response object having a VARY header or
 * not. It defaults to false.
 *
 * @property [cacheName] A DOMString that represents a specific cache to search
 * within. Note that this option is ignored by Cache.match().
