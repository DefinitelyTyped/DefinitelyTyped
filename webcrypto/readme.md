#  WebCrypto Definition Notes

## The WebCrypto specification

The WebCrypto specification is for performing basic cryptographic operations in
web applications, such as hashing, signature generation and verification, and
encryption and decryption. The API is also for applications to generate and/or
manage the keying material necessary to perform these operations. Uses for this
API range from user or service authentication, document or code signing, and the confidentiality and integrity of communications.

The latest version of the specification can be found at: http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/
