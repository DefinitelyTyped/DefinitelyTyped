     *  HtmlOutput.setSandboxMode(mode).
     * 
     * To protect users from being served malicious HTML or JavaScript, client-side code served from
     *  HTML service executes in a security sandbox that imposes restrictions on the code. The method
     *  HtmlOutput.setSandboxMode(mode) allows script authors to choose between
     *  different versions of the sandbox. For more information, see the
     *  guide to restrictions in HTML service.
     * If a script does not set a sandbox mode, Apps Script uses NATIVE mode as the default.
     *  Prior to February 2014, the default was EMULATED. The default is subject to change.
     * The IFRAME mode imposes many fewer restrictions than the other sandbox modes and runs
     *  fastest, but does not work at all in certain older browsers, including Internet Explorer 9. By
     *  contrast, EMULATED mode is more likely to work in
     *  older browsers that do not support ECMAScript 5 strict
     *  mode, most notably Internet Explorer 9. NATIVE mode is the middle ground. If
     *  NATIVE mode is set but not supported in the user's browser, the sandbox mode falls back
     *  to EMULATED mode for that user.
     * 
     *      // Serve HTML with a defined sandbox mode (in Apps Script server-side code).
     *      var output = HtmlService.createHtmlOutput('<b>Hello, world!</b>');
