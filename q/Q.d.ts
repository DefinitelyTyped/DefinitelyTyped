         * Much like then, but with different behavior around unhandled rejection. If there is an unhandled rejection, either because promise is rejected and no onRejected callback was provided, or because onFulfilled or onRejected threw an error or returned a rejected promise, the resulting rejection reason is thrown as an exception in a future turn of the event loop.

         * This method should be used to terminate chains of promises that will not be passed elsewhere. Since exceptions thrown in then callbacks are consumed and transformed into rejections, exceptions at the end of the chain are easy to accidentally, silently ignore. By arranging for the exception to be thrown in a future turn of the event loop, so that it won't be caught, it causes an onerror event on the browser window, or an uncaughtException event on Node.js's process object.
         *
         * Exceptions thrown by done will have long stack traces, if Q.longStackSupport is set to true. If Q.onerror is set, exceptions will be delivered there instead of thrown in a future turn.
