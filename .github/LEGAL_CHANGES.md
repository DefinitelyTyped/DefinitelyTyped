Legal updates included in this branch:

- Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2) to define expected community behavior.
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contribution guidance, license note (MIT), and DCO sign-off instructions.
- Updated `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to require DCO sign-off in commit messages.
- Added `.github/workflows/dco.yml`, a GitHub Actions workflow that verifies commits include a `Signed-off-by:` line for PRs.

If you prefer a different contributor agreement (CLA) instead of DCO, or want a specific contact for conduct reports, please advise and I will update accordingly.
