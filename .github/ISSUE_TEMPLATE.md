- [ ] I tried using the `@types/xxxx` package and had problems.
- [ ] I tried using the latest stable version of tsc. https://www.npmjs.com/package/typescript
- [ ] I understand that `@types` package versions [do not follow SemVer](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped#how-do-definitely-typed-package-versions-relate-to-versions-of-the-corresponding-library).
- [ ] I have a question that is inappropriate for [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).  (Please ask any appropriate questions there).
